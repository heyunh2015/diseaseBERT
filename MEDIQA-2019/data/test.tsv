I am not diagnosed but have had many test that indicate I am suffering with this, keen to learn how to get it diagnosed and how to manage, many thanks	abetalipoproteinemia: Abetalipoproteinemia is an inherited disorder that affects the absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood. Specifically, people with abetalipoproteinemia are missing a group of lipoproteins called beta-lipoproteins. An inability to make beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body&aposs cells and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye. The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. Disturbances in nerve function may cause affected people to eventually develop poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia). Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially a deficiency of vitamin E. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide. Mutations in the MTTP gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. The MTTP gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream. Most of the mutations in the MTTP gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes the nutritional and neurological problems seen in people with abetalipoproteinemia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

[1] Signs and symptoms appear in the first few months of life and can include failure to thrive; diarrhea; acanthocytosis; and stool abnormalities. Other features develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system, potentially causing slower intellectual development; poor muscle coordination; progressive ataxia ; and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. [1] [2] Most of the symptoms are due to defects in the absorption and transport of vitamin E. [2] Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [3] Early diagnosis, high-dose vitamin E therapy, and medium-chain fatty acid supplements may slow the progression of the nervous system abnormalities. Long-term outlook is reasonably good for most affected people who are diagnosed early. If left untreated, the condition can result in early death. [2] The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia usually appear in the first few months of life. They can include: failure to thrive in infancy digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and steatorrhea (foul-smelling stools) abnormal, star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) nervous system (neurologic) symptoms beginning in childhood such as slower intellectual development; peripheral neuropathy ; poor muscle coordination; ataxia ; and intention tremors eye (ophthalmologic) symptoms such as decreased night and color vision; retinitis pigmentosa in adolescence; and gradual deterioration of vision, often leading to blindness in the fourth decade of life[1][2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MTTP gene . The MTTP gene gives the body instructions to make a protein needed for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the body to absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E and K), and for transporting these substances in the blood. Mutations in the MTTP result in a lack of beta-lipoproteins, leading to an inability to absorb and transport these substances. This in turn leads to the nutritional and neurologic problems in affected people. [1] Abetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an  autosomal recessive  manner. [4] This means that to be affected, a person must have a  mutation  in both copies of the responsible  gene  in each cell . Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a  carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests available for abetalipoproteinemia. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Prenatal testing may be available for pregnancies at increased risk if the mutations in the family have been identified. A nutritionist or other qualified medical professional should be consulted for specific dietary instruction in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Treatment involves very large doses of vitamin E, as well as large doses of vitamin supplements containing other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. [3] [2] Several diet changes and/or restrictions are also needed to prevent stomach problems. A low-fat diet may help with digestive symptoms; medium chain triglycerides may be used (under supervision of a specialist) as a source of fat in the diet. [3] Management in adults typically focuses on specific complications associated with the disorder, and depends on the signs and symptoms present. Affected people may need consultations with several other types of specialists, including a lipidologist, gastroenterologist , hepatologist , ophthalmologist , and neurologist . [2] The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) is reasonably good for most people who are diagnosed and treated early. [2] However, how well each person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. [3] Therefore, the prognosis can vary. [5] People with prolonged vitamin deficiency, especially of vitamin E, may develop very limiting ataxia and gait disturbances. Some people may develop retinal degeneration and blindness.

The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins. It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include: - Balance and coordination difficulties - Curvature of spine - Decreased vision that gets worse over time - Developmental delay - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy - Muscle weakness - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10 - Protruding abdomen - Slurred speech - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa). Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include: - Apolipoprotein B blood test - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K) - "Burr-cell" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis) - Complete blood count (CBC) - Cholesterol studies - Electromyography - Eye exam - Nerve conduction velocity - Stool sample analysis Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves: - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day. - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry. - Use skim milk instead of whole milk. Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include: - Blindness - Mental deterioration - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

Thalassemia (Treatment): Treatment for thalassemia depends on which type you have and how severe it is. Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.

Sickle beta thalassemia (Treatment): Treatment for sickle beta thalassemia is supportive and usually depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. It is generally recommended that all affected people drink plenty of water; avoid climate extremes, activities that lead to inflammation and extreme fatigue; and stay up-to-date on all immunizations. Because sickle beta thalassemia is associated with a variety of health problems, affected people are usually followed closely by their healthcare provider with regular physical examinations that may include specialized laboratory tests and imaging studies (i.e. chest X-ray, transcranial doppler ultrasound, ECG). Blood transfusions may be prescribed on a regular basis for affected people with a history of or risk factors for stroke and other specific health problems, such as pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea, a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of sickle cell disease, can decrease the frequency and severity of pain episodes; reduce the need of blood transfusions; and increase life span.

Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

Anemia (Treatment): Anemia treatment depends on the cause. - Iron deficiency anemia. Treatment for this form of anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and making changes to your diet. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood - other than from menstruation - the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery. - Vitamin deficiency anemias. Treatment for folic acid and B-12 deficiency involves dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet. If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you may need vitamin B-12 shots. At first, you may receive the shots every other day. Eventually, you&aposll need shots just once a month, which may continue for life, depending on your situation. - Anemia of chronic disease. There&aposs no specific treatment for this type of anemia. Doctors focus on treating the underlying disease. If symptoms become severe, a blood transfusion or injections of synthetic erythropoietin, a hormone normally produced by your kidneys, may help stimulate red blood cell production and ease fatigue. - Aplastic anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include blood transfusions to boost levels of red blood cells. You may need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow is diseased and can&apost make healthy blood cells. - Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. Treatment of these various diseases can include medication, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. - Hemolytic anemias. Managing hemolytic anemias includes avoiding suspect medications, treating related infections and taking drugs that suppress your immune system, which may be attacking your red blood cells. Depending on the severity of your anemia, a blood transfusion or plasmapheresis may be necessary. Plasmapheresis is a type of blood-filtering procedure. In certain cases, removal of the spleen can be helpful. - Sickle cell anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include the administration of oxygen, pain-relieving drugs, and oral and intravenous fluids to reduce pain and prevent complications. Doctors also may recommend blood transfusions, folic acid supplements and antibiotics. A bone marrow transplant may be an effective treatment in some circumstances. A cancer drug called hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) also is used to treat sickle cell anemia. - Thalassemia. This anemia may be treated with blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, medication, removal of the spleen (splenectomy), or a blood and bone marrow stem cell transplant.

2.0	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Absence seizure: An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: - Occur many times a day - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed - Interfere with school and learning - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: - Wide awake - Thinking clearly - Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

1.9	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Absence seizure: Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They&aposre more common in children than in adults. Someone having an absence seizure may look like he or she is staring blankly into space for a few seconds. Then, there is a quick return to a normal level of alertness. This type of seizure usually doesn&apost lead to physical injury. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medications. Some children who have them also develop other seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens. An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include: - Sudden stop in motion without falling - Lip smacking - Eyelid flutters - Chewing motions - Finger rubbing - Small movements of both hands Afterward, there&aposs no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they&aposre so brief. A decline in a child&aposs learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child&aposs inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming. Contact your doctor: - The first time you notice a seizure - If this is a new type of seizure - If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medication Contact 911 or emergency services in your area: - If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours - activities such as eating or moving without awareness - or prolonged confusion, possible symptoms of a condition called absence status epilepticus - After any seizure lasting more than five minutes Many children appear to have a genetic predisposition to absence seizures. In general, seizures are caused by abnormal electrical impulses from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain&aposs nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain&aposs usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. People who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters). Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: - Age. Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14. - Sex. Absence seizures are more common in girls. - Family members who have seizures. Nearly half of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures. Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include: - Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern. - Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation. Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Children may be able to taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor&aposs supervision, after they&aposve been seizure-free for two years. Drugs prescribed for absence seizure include: - Ethosuximide (Zarontin). This is the drug most doctors start with for absence seizures. In most cases, seizures respond well to this drug. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, hyperactivity. - Valproic acid (Depakene). Girls who continue to need medication into adulthood should discuss potential risks of valproic acid with their doctors. Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies, and doctors advise women against using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive. Doctors may recommend the use of valproic acid in children who have both absence and grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures. - Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this drug to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea. Dietary therapy Following a diet that&aposs high in fat and low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. This is used only if traditional medications fail to control the seizures. This diet isn&apost easy to maintain, but is successful at reducing seizures for some people. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, though less effective, aren&apost as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and may also provide benefit. Additional options Here are other steps you might take to help with seizure control: - Take medication correctly. Don&apost adjust the dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly if you have another seizure. - Ask your doctor about driving or recreation restrictions. Someone with a seizure disorder will have to be seizure-free for reasonable lengths of time (intervals vary from state to state) before being able to drive.

It can cause changes in your behavior, movements or feelings, and in levels of consciousness. If you have two or more seizures or a tendency to have recurrent seizures, you have epilepsy. There are many types of seizures, which range in severity. Seizure types vary by where and how they begin in the brain. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to two minutes. A seizure that lasts longer than five minutes is a medical emergency. Seizures are more common than you might think. Seizures can happen after a stroke, a closed head injury, an infection such as meningitis or another illness. Many times, though, the cause of a seizure is unknown. Most seizure disorders can be controlled with medication, but management of seizures can still have a significant impact on your daily life. The good news is you can work with your health care professional to balance seizure control and medication side effects. Seizure care at Mayo Clinic With a seizure, signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary depending on the type of seizure. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where abnormal brain activity begins. Seizures may also be classified as unknown onset, if how the seizure began isn&apost known. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in one area of your brain. Focal seizures can occur with or without loss of consciousness: - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. You may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. These seizures may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound, but you don&apost lose consciousness. These seizures may also result in the involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include: - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or by subtle body movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn&apost return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You&aposre experiencing heat exhaustion. - You&aposre pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You&aposve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Nerve cells (neurons) in the brain create, send and receive electrical impulses, which allow the brain&aposs nerve cells to communicate. Anything that disrupts these communication pathways can lead to a seizure. The most common cause of seizures is epilepsy. But not every person who has a seizure has epilepsy. Sometimes seizures happen because of: - High fever, which can be associated with an infection such as meningitis - Lack of sleep - Low blood sodium (hyponatremia), which can happen with diuretic therapy - Medications, such as certain pain relievers, antidepressants or smoking cessation therapies, that lower the seizure threshold - Head trauma that causes an area of bleeding in the brain - Stroke - Brain tumor - Illegal or recreational drugs, such as amphetamines or cocaine - Alcohol abuse, during times of withdrawal or extreme intoxication After a seizure, your doctor will thoroughly review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to determine the cause of your seizure and evaluate how likely it is that you&aposll have another one. Tests may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities and mental function to determine if you have a problem with your brain and nervous system. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions, blood sugar levels or electrolyte imbalances. - Lumbar puncture. If your doctor suspects an infection as the cause of a seizure, you may need to have a sample of cerebrospinal fluid removed for testing. - An electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain, which shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may reveal a pattern that tells doctors whether a seizure is likely to occur again. EEG testing may also help your doctor exclude other conditions that mimic epilepsy as a reason for your seizure. Depending on the details of your seizures, this test may be done as an outpatient in the clinic, overnight at home with an ambulatory device or over a few nights in the hospital. - Computerized tomography (CT). A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might cause a seizure, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could lead to seizures. - Positron emission tomography (PET). A PET scan uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain that happens during a seizure. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. This test is usually done in a hospital with overnight EEG recording. Not everyone who has one seizure will have another one, and because a seizure can be an isolated incident, your doctor may not decide to start treatment until you&aposve had more than one. The optimal goal in seizure treatment is to find the best possible therapy to stop seizures, with the fewest side effects. Medication Treatment for seizures often involves the use of anti-seizure medications. Several options exist for anti-seizure medications. The goal is to find the medicine that works best for you and that causes the fewest side effects. In some cases, your doctor might recommend more than one medication. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, your frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won&apost interact with them. Surgery and other therapies If anti-seizure medications aren&apost effective, other treatments may be an option: - Surgery. The goal of surgery is to stop seizures from happening. Surgeons locate and remove the area of your brain where seizures begin. Surgery works best for people who have seizures that always originate in the same place in their brains. - Vagus nerve stimulation. A device implanted underneath the skin of your chest stimulates the vagus nerve in your neck, sending signals to your brain that inhibit seizures. With vagus nerve stimulation, you may still need to take medication, but you may be able to lower the dose. - Responsive neurostimulation. During responsive neurostimulation, a device implanted on the surface of your brain or within brain tissue can detect seizure activity and deliver an electrical stimulation to the detected area to stop the seizure. - Deep brain stimulation. Doctors implant electrodes within certain areas of your brain to produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal brain activity. The electrodes attach to a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin of your chest, which controls the amount of stimulation produced. - Dietary therapy. Following a diet that&aposs high in fat and low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the low glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, though less effective, aren&apost as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and may provide benefit. Pregnancy and seizures Women who&aposve had previous seizures typically are able to have healthy pregnancies. Birth defects related to certain medications can sometimes occur. In particular, valproic acid - one possible medication for generalized seizures - has been associated with cognitive deficits and neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that women avoid using valproic acid during pregnancy because of risks to the baby. Discuss these risks with your doctor. Because of the risk of birth defects and because pregnancy can alter medication levels, preconception planning is particularly important for women who&aposve had seizures. In some cases, it may be appropriate to change the dose of seizure medication before or during pregnancy. Medications may be switched in rare cases. Contraception and anti-seizure medications Some anti-seizure medications can alter the effectiveness of birth control (oral contraceptive) medication. If contraception is a high priority, check with your doctor to evaluate whether your medication interacts with your oral contraceptive, and if other forms of contraception need to be considered. Here are some steps you can take to help with seizure control: - Take medication correctly. Don&apost adjust the dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly if you have another seizure. - Be active. Exercising and being active may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water and rest if you get tired during exercise. - Make healthy life choices. Managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes all factor in to a healthy lifestyle. Personal safety Seizures don&apost usually result in serious injury, but if you have recurrent seizures, injury is a possibility. These steps can help you avoid injury during a seizure: - Take care near water. Don&apost swim alone or relax in a boat without someone nearby. - Wear a helmet for protection during activities such as bike riding or sports participation. - Take showers instead of baths, unless someone is near you. - Modify your furnishings. Pad sharp corners, buy furniture with rounded edges and choose chairs that have arms to keep you from falling off the chair. Consider carpet with thick padding to protect you if you do fall. - Display seizure first-aid tips in a place where people can easily see them. Include any important phone numbers there, too. Seizure first aid It&aposs helpful to know what to do if you witness someone having a seizure. If you&aposre at risk of having seizures in the future, pass this information along to family, friends and co-workers so that they know what to do if you have a seizure. To help someone during a seizure, take these steps: - Carefully roll the person onto one side - Place something soft under his or her head - Loosen tight neckwear - Avoid putting your fingers or other objects in the person&aposs mouth - Don&apost try to restrain someone having a seizure - Clear away dangerous objects, if the person is moving - Stay with the person until medical personnel arrive - Observe the person closely so that you can provide details on what happened - Time the seizure - Stay calm
1.8	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Epilepsy juvenile absence: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a &apos&aposstaring spell&apos&apos that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.

-0.5	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Seizures: A seizure is the physical findings or changes in behavior that occur after an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The term "seizure" is often used interchangeably with "convulsion." During convulsions a person has uncontrollable shaking that is rapid and rhythmic, with the muscles contract and relax repeatedly. There are many different types of seizures. Some have mild symptoms without shaking. It may be hard to tell if someone is having a seizure. Some seizures only cause a person to have staring spells. These may go unnoticed. Specific symptoms depend on which part of the brain is involved. Symptoms occur suddenly and may include: - Brief blackout followed by a period of confusion (the person cannot remember for a short time) - Changes in behavior, such as picking at one&aposs clothing - Drooling or frothing at the mouth - Eye movements - Grunting and snorting - Loss of bladder or bowel control - Mood changes, such as sudden anger, unexplainable fear, panic, joy, or laughter - Shaking of the entire body - Sudden falling - Tasting a bitter or metallic flavor - Teeth clenching - Temporary stop in breathing - Uncontrollable muscle spasms with twitching and jerking limbs Symptoms may stop after a few seconds or minutes, or continue for up to 15 minutes. They rarely continue longer. The person may have warning symptoms before the attack, such as: - Fear or anxiety - Nausea - Vertigo (feeling as if you are spinning or moving) - Visual symptoms (such as flashing bright lights, spots, or wavy lines before the eyes) Seizures of all types are caused by disorganized and sudden electrical activity in the brain. Causes of seizures can include: - Abnormal levels of sodium or glucose in the blood - Brain infection, including meningitis - Brain injury that occurs to the baby during labor or childbirth - Brain problems that occur before birth (congenital brain defects) - Brain tumor (rare) - Drug abuse - Electric shock - Epilepsy - Fever (particularly in young children) - Head injury - Heart disease - Heat illness (heat intolerance) - High fever - Phenylketonuria (PKU), which can cause seizures in infants - Poisoning - Street drugs, such as angel dust (PCP), cocaine, amphetamines - Stroke - Toxemia of pregnancy - Toxin buildup in the body due to liver or kidney failure - Very high blood pressure (malignant hypertension) - Venomous bites and stings (snake bite) - Withdrawal from alcohol or certain medicines after using for a long time Sometimes, no cause can be found. This is called idiopathic seizures. They are usually seen in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. There may be a family history of epilepsy or seizures. If seizures continue repeatedly after the underlying problem is treated, the condition is called epilepsy. Most seizures stop by themselves. But during a seizure, the person can be hurt or injured. When a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the person from injury: - Try to prevent a fall. Lay the person on the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. - Cushion the person&aposs head. - Loosen tight clothing, especially around the neck. - Turn the person on their side. If vomiting occurs, this helps make sure that the vomit is not inhaled into the lungs. - Look for a medical ID bracelet with seizure instructions. - Stay with the person until he or she recovers, or until professional medical help arrives. Things friends and family members should NOT do: - DO NOT restrain (try to hold down) the person. - DO NOT place anything between the person&aposs teeth during a seizure (including your fingers). - DO NOT move the person unless they are in danger or near something hazardous. - DO NOT try to make the person stop convulsing. They have no control over the seizure and are not aware of what is happening at the time. - DO NOT give the person anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and the person is fully awake and alert. - DO NOT start CPR unless the seizure has clearly stopped and the person is not breathing or has no pulse. If a baby or child has a seizure during a high fever, cool the child slowly with lukewarm water. DO NOT place the child in a cold bath. Call your child&aposs health care provider and ask what you should do next. Also, ask if it is OK to give the child acetaminophen (Tylenol) once he or she is awake. Call 911 or your local emergency number if: - This is the first time the person has had a seizure - A seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes - The person does not awaken or have normal behavior after a seizure - Another seizure starts soon after a seizure ends - The person had a seizure in water - The person is pregnant, injured, or has diabetes - The person does not have a medical ID bracelet (instructions explaining what to do) - There is anything different about this seizure compared to the person&aposs usual seizures Report all seizures to the person&aposs provider. The provider may need to adjust or change the person&aposs medicines. A person who has had a new or severe seizure is usually seen in a hospital emergency room. The provider will try to diagnose the type of seizure based on the symptoms. Tests will be done to rule out other medical conditions that cause seizures or similar symptoms. This may include fainting, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, panic attacks, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, among others. Tests that may be ordered include: - Blood tests - CT scan of the head or MRI of the head - EEG (usually not in the emergency room) - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Further testing is needed if a person has: - A new seizure without a clear cause - Epilepsy (to make sure the person is taking the right amount of medicine) Updated by: Amit M.

Mental or physical	Tranebjaerg Svejgaard syndrome: Tranebjaerg Svejgaard syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by intellectual disability , seizures and psoriasis. It has been reported in four male cousins. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, it is thought to be inherited in an X-linked manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications to control seizures.

-1.8	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Absence of the Septum Pellucidum: The septum pellucidum (SP) is a thin membrane located at the midline of the brain between the two cerebral hemispheres, or halves of the brain.. It is connected to the corpus callosum -- a collection of nerve fibers that connect the cerebral hemispherers.  This rare abnormality accompanies various malformations of the brain that affect intelligence, behavior, and the neurodevelopmental process, and seizures may occur. Children who are born without this membrane and also have other abnormalities--pituitary deficiencies and abnormal development of the optic disk--have a disorder known as septo-optic dysplasia.  More information about this condition can be located at the NINDS Septo-Optic Dysplasia Information Page. Absence of the SP alone is not a disorder but is instead a characteristic noted in children with septo-optic dysplasia or other developmental anomalies. When the absence of the septum pellucidum is part of septo-optic dysplasia, the prognosis varies according to the presence and severity of associated symptoms.  By itself, absence of the septum pellucidum is not life-threatening.
-1.9	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Absence of septum pellucidum: The absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare condition that affects the structure of the brain. Specifically, a thin membrane called the septum pellucidum is missing from its normal position in the middle of the brain. [1] When it is missing, symptoms may include learning difficulties, behavioral changes, seizures , and changes in vision. Absence of the septum pellucidum is not typically seen as an isolated finding. Instead, absence of the septum pellucidum is associated with other conditions such as septo-optic dysplasia. [2] Treatment options for the condition vary depending on the underlying disorder. Diagnosis of absence of the septum pellucidum can be made through imaging such as an MRI. Symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum typically present during childhood, but a diagnosis can also be made before an individual is born (prenatally). [3] If an individual is found to be missing the septum pellucidum, a search for  an underlying disorder should be made. The symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum may vary, and it may be difficult to determine which symptoms are due to  the  underlying disorder and which ones are due to absence of the septum pellucidum.  Symptoms that are common among people with absence of the septum pellucidum include learning disabilities, seizures , and behavioral changes. The septum pellucidum provides information to the rest of the body about how the body is doing. This information may include whether or not the body has received enough sleep or food, or whether the environment is safe. [4] Therefore, an absence of the septum pellucidum may cause an individual to feel hungry even when they are not or tired when they have had enough sleep. Some people with absence of the septum pellucidum do not grow very tall or have a high body mass index (BMI). This means that they have a higher weight than is typical for their height. [5] Absence of the septum pellucidum can be caused by multiple factors depending on the underlying condition. Some people are born with or develop hydrocephalus , or a fluid buildup in the brain. If this condition goes untreated, the excess fluid can disintegrate the septum pellucidum. Absence of the septum pellucidum can also be the result of a genetic condition that is present in a baby at birth. Additionally, the septum pellucidum is connected to another brain structure called the corpus callosum , which is responsible for sending information between the two halves of the brain. Some people are born with a missing corpus callosum. People with a missing corpus callosum will also have a missing septum pellucidum. [1]  The long-term outlook or prognosis for individuals affected by absence of the septum pellucidum varies depending on the underlying cause of the condition. Some of the symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum may be treated. For example, medications can be used to help relieve seizures or treat any behavioral changes. Growth hormone may be prescribed for individuals who have a high body mass index and are short in stature. By itself, absence of the septum pellucidum is not life-threatening. However, the prognosis of certain conditions that cause absence of the septum pellucidum may differ. [1] [5]
-0.7	Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical	Febrile Seizures: Febrile seizures are convulsions or seizures  in infants or small children that are brought on by a fever. Most often during a febrile seizure, a child loses consciousness and shakes uncontrollably.  Less commonly, a child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two; some can be as brief as a few seconds, while others may last for more than 15 minutes. Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure.  Febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with the risk peaking in the second year of life. The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more.  A few factors appear to boost a child&aposs risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age (less than 18 months) during the first seizures and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures. A child who has a febrile seizure usually doesn&apost need to be hospitalized. If the seizure is prolonged or is accompanied by a serious infection, or if the source of the infection cannot be determined, a doctor may recommend that the child be hospitalized for observation. Prolonged daily use of anti-seizure medicines is usually not recommended because of their potential for harmful side effects. Children especially prone to febrile seizures may be treated with medication when they have a fever to lower the risk of having another febrile seizure. The vast majority of febrile seizures are short and harmless. There is no evidence that short febrile seizures cause brain damage. Multiple or prolonged seizures are a risk factor for epilepsy but most children who experience febrile seizures do not go on to develop the reoccurring seizures that re characteristic of epilepsy. Certain children who have febrile seizures face an increased risk of developing epilepsy. These children include those who have a febrile seizure that lasts longer than 10 minutes, who have febrile seizures that are lengthy or affect only one part of the body, or experience seizures that reoccur within 24 hours..

Adrenoleukodystrophy (Treatment): Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition.
1.71428571429	adrenoleukodystrophy A child I have been asked to work with has been diagnosed with this condition.I am so far unable to find info pertaining to this illness. Can you help??	What is Adrenoleukodystrophy?: X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison&aposs disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD. X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (Treatment): Adrenal function must be tested periodically in all patients with ALD. Treatment with adrenal hormones can be lifesaving. Symptomatic and supportive treatments for ALD include physical therapy, psychological support, and special education. Recent evidence suggests that a mixture of oleic acid and erucic acid, known as "Lorenzo&aposs Oil," administered to boys with X-ALD prior to symptom onset can prevent or delay the appearance of the childhood cerebral form  It is not known whether Lorenzo&aposs Oil will have any beneficial effects in AMN.  Furthermore, Lorenzo&aposs Oil has no beneficial effect in symptomatic boys with X-ALD.  Bone marrow transplantations can provide long-term benefit to boys who have early evidence of the childhood cerebral form of X-ALD, but the procedure carries risk of mortality and morbidity and is not recommended for those whose symptoms are already severe or who have the adult-onset or neonatal forms.
2.0	adrenoleukodystrophy A child I have been asked to work with has been diagnosed with this condition.I am so far unable to find info pertaining to this illness. Can you help??	Adrenoleukodystrophy: Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are 3 major categories of disease: - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements - Crossed eyes - Handwriting that gets worse - Difficulty at school - Difficulty understanding what people are saying - Hearing loss - Hyperactivity - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis - Seizures - Swallowing difficulties - Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: - Difficulty controlling urination - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: - Coma - Decreased appetite - Increased skin color - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) - Muscle weakness - Vomiting Tests for this condition include: - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur: - Adrenal crisis - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if: - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (Summary): X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited  condition that occurs mostly in males.  The condition mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands (small glands located on top of each kidney). People with this disorder often have progressive destruction of the fatty covering ( myelin ) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord. They may also have a shortage of certain hormones caused by damage to the outer layer of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex), called adrenocortical insufficiency.  X-ALD is caused by mutations in the  gene . These gene mutations cause a shortage (deficiency) of a protein  called adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP).  A deficiency of this protein leads to an abnormally high level of fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) to build up in the body.  High levels of VLCFA may be toxic to the adrenal cortex and myelin.   There are several forms of X-ALD including: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type, and an adrenal insufficiency-only type. Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the condition [1] A specific treatment for X-ALD is not currently available, but eating a diet low in VLCFA and taking special oils can lower the blood levels of VLCFA.  Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be an option for boys and adolescents in early stages who have evidence of brain involvement on MRI . [2]  Adrenocortical insufficiency is treated with cortisone replacement.

Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn&aposs disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren&apost sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn&aposs disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you&aposve experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure&aposs location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn&aposs disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you&aposre younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you&aposll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child&aposs doctor.

0.857142857143	Angelman syndrome. Can a person with Angelman Syndrome have children? If so, can the disorder be passed on to offspring?	Angelman syndrome: Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood. Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as "coarse." Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal. Angelman syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people. Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body&aposs tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person&aposs mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases. In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next. Buiting K.

0.571428571429	Angelman syndrome. Can a person with Angelman Syndrome have children? If so, can the disorder be passed on to offspring?	Angelman syndrome: Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder. It causes developmental disabilities, neurological problems and sometimes, seizures. People with Angelman syndrome often smile and laugh frequently, and have happy, excitable personalities. Developmental delays, between about 6 and 12 months of age, are usually the first signs of Angelman syndrome. Seizures often begin between the ages of 2 and 3 years old. People with Angelman syndrome tend to live a normal life span, but the disease cannot be cured. Treatment focuses on managing medical and developmental issues. Angelman syndrome signs and symptoms include: - Developmental delays, including no crawling or babbling at 6 to 12 months - Intellectual disability - No speech or minimal speech - Difficulty walking, moving or balancing well (ataxia) - Frequent smiling and laughter - Happy, excitable personality People who have Angelman syndrome may also have other signs and symptoms, including: - Seizures, usually beginning between 2 and 3 years of age - Stiff or jerky movements - Small head size, with flatness in the back of the head (microbrachycephaly) - Tongue thrusting - Hair, skin and eyes that are light in color (hypopigmentation) - Unusual behaviors, such as hand flapping and arms uplifted while walking Most babies with Angelman syndrome don&apost show signs or symptoms at birth. The first signs of Angelman syndrome are usually developmental delays, such as lack of crawling or babbling, between 6 and 12 months. If your child seems to have developmental delays or if your child has other signs or symptoms of Angelman syndrome, make an appointment with your child&aposs doctor. Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder. It&aposs usually caused by problems with a gene located on chromosome 15 called the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. You receive your pairs of genes from your parents - one copy from your mother (maternal copy) and the other from your father (paternal copy). Your cells typically use information from both copies, but in a small number of genes, only one copy is active. Normally, only the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is active in the brain. Most cases of Angelman syndrome occur when part of the maternal copy is missing or damaged. In a few cases, Angelman syndrome is caused when two paternal copies of the gene are inherited, instead of one from each parent. Angelman syndrome is rare. Researchers usually don&apost know what causes the genetic changes that result in Angelman syndrome. Most people with Angelman syndrome don&apost have a family history of the disease. Occasionally, Angelman syndrome may be inherited from a parent. A family history of the disease may increase a baby&aposs risk of developing Angelman syndrome. Complications associated with Angelman syndrome include: - Feeding difficulties. Difficulty coordinating sucking and swallowing may cause feeding problems in infants. Your pediatrician may recommend a high-calorie formula to help your baby gain weight. - Hyperactivity. Children with Angelman syndrome often move quickly from one activity to another, have a short attention span, and keep their hands or a toy in their mouths. Hyperactivity often decreases with age, and medication usually isn&apost necessary. - Sleep disorders. People with Angelman syndrome often have abnormal sleep-wake patterns and need less sleep than most people. Sleep difficulties may improve with age. Medication and behavior therapy may help control sleep disorders. - Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Some people with Angelman syndrome develop an abnormal side-to-side spinal curvature over time. - Obesity. Older children with Angelman syndrome tend to have large appetites, which may lead to obesity. Your child&aposs doctor may suspect Angelman syndrome if your child has developmental delays and other signs and symptoms of the disorder, such as problems with movement and balance, small head size, flatness in the back of the head, and frequent laughter. Confirming a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome requires taking a blood sample from your child for genetic studies. A combination of genetic tests can reveal the chromosome defects related to Angelman syndrome. These tests may review: - Parental DNA pattern. This test, known as a DNA methylation test, screens for three of the four known genetic abnormalities that cause Angelman syndrome. - Missing chromosomes. Either a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test or a comparative genomic hybridization test (CGH) can show if portions of chromosomes are missing. - Gene mutation. Rarely, Angelman syndrome may occur when a person&aposs maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is active, but mutated. If results from a DNA methylation test are normal, your child&aposs doctor may order a UBE3A gene sequencing test to look for a maternal mutation. There&aposs no cure for Angelman syndrome. Research is focusing on targeting specific genes for treatment. Current treatment focuses on managing the medical and developmental issues. A team of health care professionals will likely work with you to manage your child&aposs condition. Depending on your child&aposs signs and symptoms, treatment for Angelman syndrome may involve: - Anti-seizure medication to control seizures - Physical therapy to help with walking and movement problems - Communication therapy, which may include sign language and picture communication - Behavior therapy to help overcome hyperactivity and a short attention span and to aid in development

My father age is 55 We discover the dissease by blood test	Hairy cell leukemia (Treatment): Treatment isn&apost always necessary for people with hairy cell leukemia. Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn&apost progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it&aposs given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn&apost been effective or if you can&apost take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it&aposs sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven&apost worked for you or you can&apost take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it&aposs enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can&apost cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn&apost commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection.

My father age is 55 We discover the dissease by blood test	Hairy cell leukemia (Symptoms): Some people have no signs or symptoms of hairy cell leukemia, but a blood test for another disease or condition may inadvertently reveal hairy cell leukemia. Other times people with hairy cell leukemia experience signs and symptoms common to a number of diseases and conditions, such as: - A feeling of fullness in your abdomen that may make it uncomfortable to eat more than a little at a time - Fatigue - Easy bruising - Recurring infections - Weakness - Weight loss When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.

My father age is 55 We discover the dissease by blood test	Hairy cell leukemia (Diagnosis): To diagnose hairy cell leukemia, your doctor may recommend tests and procedures that include: - Physical exam. By feeling your spleen - an oval-shaped organ on the left side of your upper abdomen - your doctor can determine if it&aposs enlarged. An enlarged spleen may cause a sensation of fullness in your abdomen that makes it uncomfortable to eat. Your doctor may also check for enlarged lymph nodes that may contain leukemia cells. - Blood tests. Your doctor uses blood tests, such as the complete blood count, to monitor the levels of blood cells in your blood. People with hairy cell leukemia have low levels of all three types of blood cells - red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Another blood test called a peripheral blood smear looks for hairy cell leukemia cells in a sample of your blood. - Bone marrow biopsy. During a bone marrow biopsy, a small amount of bone marrow is removed from your hip area. This sample is used to look for hairy cell leukemia cells and to monitor your healthy blood cells. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan shows detailed images of the inside of your body. Your doctor may order a CT scan to detect enlargement of your spleen and your lymph nodes.

2.0	asthma Question. What is the consensus of medical doctors as to whether asthma can be cured? And do you have an article discussing whether asthma can be cured?	Asthma (Overview): Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can&apost be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it&aposs important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.
-0.75	asthma Question. What is the consensus of medical doctors as to whether asthma can be cured? And do you have an article discussing whether asthma can be cured?	Asthma - children: Asthma is a disease that causes the airways to swell and get narrow. It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. Less air is able to pass through as a result. Asthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together. In children who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers. Common asthma triggers include: - Animals (hair or dander) - Dust, mold, and pollen - Aspirin and other medicines - Changes in weather (most often cold weather) - Chemicals in the air or in food - Tobacco smoke - Exercise - Strong emotions - Viral infections, such as the common cold Breathing problems are common. They can include: - Shortness of breath - Feeling out of breath - Gasping for air - Trouble breathing out (exhaling) - Breathing faster than normal When the child is having a hard time breathing, the skin of the chest and neck may suck inward. Other symptoms of asthma in children include: - Coughing that sometimes wakes the child up at night (it may be the only symptom). - Dark bags under the eyes. - Feeling tired. - Irritability. - Tightness in the chest. - A whistling sound made when breathing (wheezing). You may notice it more when the child breathes out. Your child&aposs asthma symptoms may vary. Symptoms may appear often or develop only when triggers are present. Some children are more likely to have asthma symptoms at night. The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to the child&aposs lungs. The provider may be able to hear asthma sounds. However, lung sounds are often normal when the child is not having an asthma episode. The provider will have the child breathe into a device called a peak flow meter. Peak flow meters can tell how well the child can blow air out of the lungs. If the airways are narrow due to asthma, peak flow values drop. You and your child will learn to measure peak flow at home. Tests may include: - Allergy testing on the skin, or a blood test to see if your child is allergic to certain substances - Chest x-ray - Lung function tests You and your child&aposs providers should work together as a team to create and carry out an asthma action plan. This plan will tell you how to: - Avoid asthma triggers - Monitor symptoms - Measure peak flow - Take medicines The plan should also tell you when to call the provider. It is important to know what questions to ask your child&aposs provider. Children with asthma need a lot of support at school. - Give the school staff your asthma action plan so they know how to take care of your child&aposs asthma. - Find out how to let your child take medicine during school hours. (You may need to sign a consent form.) - Having asthma does not mean your child cannot exercise. Coaches, gym teachers, and your child should know what to do if your child has asthma symptoms caused by exercise. ASTHMA MEDICINES There are two basic kinds of medicine used to treat asthma. Long-term control drugs are taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms. Your child should take these medicines even if no symptoms are present. Some children may need more than one long-term control medicine. Types of long-term control medicines include: - Inhaled steroids (these are usually the first choice of treatment) - Long-acting bronchodilators (these are almost always used with inhaled steroids) - Leukotriene inhibitors - Cromolyn sodium Quick relief or rescue asthma drugs work fast to control asthma symptoms. Children take them when they are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. Some of your child&aposs asthma medicines can be taken using an inhaler. - Children who use an inhaler should use a spacer device. This helps them get the medicine into the lungs properly. - If your child uses the inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets into the lungs. Have your provider show your child how to correctly use an inhaler. - Younger children can use a nebulizer instead of an inhaler to take their medicine. A nebulizer turns asthma medicine into a mist. GETTING RID OF TRIGGERS It is important to know your child&aposs asthma triggers. Avoiding them is the first step toward helping your child feel better. Keep pets outdoors, or at least away from the child&aposs bedroom. No one should smoke in a house or around a child with asthma. - Getting rid of tobacco smoke in the home is the single most important thing a family can do to help a child with asthma. - Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. - DO NOT use indoor fireplaces. Keep the house clean. Keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches, which can trigger asthma attacks. Cleaning products in the home should be unscented. MONITOR YOUR CHILD&aposS ASTHMA Checking peak flow is one of the best ways to control asthma. It can help you keep your child&aposs asthma from getting worse. Asthma attacks usually DO NOT happen without warning. Children under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child&aposs asthma symptoms. With proper treatment, most children with asthma can live a normal life. When asthma is not well controlled, it can lead to missed school, problems playing sports, missed work for parents, and many visits to the doctor&aposs office and emergency room. Asthma symptoms often lessen or go away completely as the child gets older. Asthma that is not well controlled can lead to lasting lung problems. In rare cases, asthma is a life-threatening disease. Families need to work closely with their providers to develop a plan to care for a child with asthma. Call your child&aposs provider if you think your child has new symptoms of asthma. If your child has been diagnosed with asthma, call the provider: - After an emergency room visit - When peak flow numbers have been getting lower - When symptoms get more frequent and more severe, even though your child is following the asthma action plan If your child is having trouble breathing or having an asthma attack, get medical help right away. Emergency symptoms include: - Difficulty breathing - Bluish color to the lips and face - Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath - Rapid pulse - Sweating - Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion A child who is having a severe asthma attack may need to stay in the hospital and get oxygen and medicines through a vein (intravenous line or IV).

0.625	asthma Question. What is the consensus of medical doctors as to whether asthma can be cured? And do you have an article discussing whether asthma can be cured?	Asthma (Treatment): The goals of treatment are: - Control airway swelling - Stay away from substances that trigger your symptoms - Help you to be able to do normal activities without asthma symptoms You and your doctor should work as a team to manage your asthma. Follow your doctor&aposs instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms. MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma: - Control medicines to help prevent attacks - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks LONG-TERM MEDICINES These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK. Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken: - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs. Quick-relief medicines include: - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV). ASTHMA CARE AT HOME - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for. - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means. - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens. - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise. Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include: - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your provider A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs. - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action. - Peak flow values of 50% to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack.

-0.8	Bad Breath I have very bad breath and at times it can make myself and others sick. I need some advice as to what I need to do.	Breath odor (Summary): Breath odor is the scent of the air you breathe out of your mouth. Unpleasant breath odor is commonly called bad breath.
2.0	Bad Breath I have very bad breath and at times it can make myself and others sick. I need some advice as to what I need to do.	What is Bad Breath?: There are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you don&apost brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor. Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.
0.8	Bad Breath I have very bad breath and at times it can make myself and others sick. I need some advice as to what I need to do.	Breath odor (Home Care): Use proper dental hygiene, especially flossing. Remember that mouthwashes are not effective in treating the underlying problem. Fresh parsley or a strong mint is often an effective way to fight temporary bad breath. Avoid smoking. Otherwise, follow your health care provider&aposs instructions to treat any underlying cause of bad breath.
0.6	Bad Breath I have very bad breath and at times it can make myself and others sick. I need some advice as to what I need to do.	Bad breath (Treatment): To reduce bad breath, help avoid cavities and lower your risk of gum disease, consistently practice good oral hygiene. Further treatment for bad breath can vary, depending on the cause. If your bad breath is thought to be caused by an underlying health condition, your dentist will likely refer you to your primary care provider. For causes related to oral health, your dentist will work with you to help you better control that condition. Dental measures may include: - Mouth rinses and toothpastes. If your bad breath is due to a buildup of bacteria (plaque) on your teeth, your dentist may recommend a mouth rinse that kills the bacteria. Your dentist may also recommend a toothpaste that contains an antibacterial agent to kill the bacteria that cause plaque buildup. - Treatment of dental disease. If you have gum disease, you may be referred to a gum specialist (periodontist). Gum disease can cause gums to pull away from your teeth, leaving deep pockets that fill with odor-causing bacteria. Sometimes only professional cleaning removes these bacteria. Your dentist might also recommend replacing faulty tooth restorations, a breeding ground for bacteria.
0.4	Bad Breath I have very bad breath and at times it can make myself and others sick. I need some advice as to what I need to do.	Breath odor (Causes): Bad breath may be caused by: - Abscessed tooth - Alcoholism - Cavities - Dentures - Eating certain foods, such as cabbage, garlic, or raw onions - Coffee and poorly pH-balanced diet - Object stuck in the nose (usually happens in kids); often a white, yellow, or bloody discharge from one nostril - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Gum disease (gingivitis, gingivostomatitis) - Impacted tooth - Lung infection - Poor dental hygiene - Sinus infection - Throat infection - Tobacco smoking - Vitamin supplements (especially in large doses) - Some medicines, including insulin shots, triamterene, and paraldehyde Some diseases that may be cause breath odor are: - Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis - Acute necrotizing ulcerative mucositis - Acute renal failure - Bowel obstruction - Bronchiectasis - Chronic kidney failure - Esophageal cancer - Gastric carcinoma - Gastrojejunocolic fistula - Hepatic encephalopathy - Diabetic ketoacidosis - Lung abscess - Ozena, or atrophic rhinitis - Periodontal disease - Pharyngitis - Zenker diverticulum

Finally, I&aposve been told acupuncture can help for mood disorders. Is that true for mixed bipolar and generalized anxiety disorder along with meds? Have you ever heard of this?	Generalized anxiety disorder (Treatment): Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you&aposve avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren&apost a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.

Finally, I&aposve been told acupuncture can help for mood disorders. Is that true for mixed bipolar and generalized anxiety disorder along with meds? Have you ever heard of this?	Generalized anxiety disorder: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental disorder in which a person is often worried or anxious about many things and finds it hard to control this anxiety. The cause of GAD is unknown. Genes may play a role. Stress may also contribute to the development of GAD. GAD is a common condition. Anyone can develop this disorder, even children. GAD occurs more often in women than in men. The main symptom is frequent worry or tension for at least 6 months, even when there is little or no clear cause. Worries seem to float from one problem to another. Problems may involve family, other relationships, work, school, money, and health. Even when aware that worries or fears are stronger than appropriate for the situation, a person with GAD still has difficulty controlling them. Other symptoms of GAD include: - Problems concentrating - Fatigue - Irritability - Problems falling or staying asleep, or sleep that is restless and unsatisfying - Restlessness when awake The person may also have other physical symptoms. These can include muscle tension, upset stomach, sweating, or difficulty breathing. There is no test that can make a diagnosis of GAD. The diagnosis is based on your answers to questions about the symptoms of GAD. Your health care provider will ask about these symptoms. You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health. A physical exam or lab tests may be done to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms. The goal of treatment is to help you feel better and function well in daily life. Talk therapy or medicine alone can be helpful. Sometimes, a combination of these may work best. TALK THERAPY Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, behaviors, and symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people&aposs behavior or life events. - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones. Other types of talk therapy may also be helpful in managing symptoms of an anxiety disorder. MEDICINES Certain medicines, usually used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider. Medicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed. - These medicines should only be taken under a doctor&aposs direction. - Your doctor will prescribe a limited amount of these drugs. They should not to be used everyday. - They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms. - If you are prescribed a sedative, do not drink alcohol while on this medicine. SELF-CARE Other than taking medicine and going to therapy, you can help yourself get better by: - Reducing caffeine - Not using street drugs or large amounts of alcohol - Exercising, getting enough rest, and eating healthy foods You can ease the stress of having GAD by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but can be a helpful addition. Resources for more information include: Anxiety and Depression Association of America: www.adaa.org National Institute of Mental Health: www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml  How well a person does depends on how severe the condition is. In some cases, GAD is long-term and is difficult to treat. Most people, though, get better with medicine and/or talk therapy. Depression and substance abuse may occur with an anxiety disorder. Call your provider if you frequently worry or feel anxious, especially if it interferes with your daily activities. Updated by: Fred K.

-0.5	Breast cancer at 84. My mother was just diagnost with breast cancer. She is 84 years old, her tumor started in the milk duct and is small in size, their is a mass as well in the same breast. He is scheduled for a lumpectomy to remove both. Because of age we would like suggestions on treatment options after surgery.	Recurrent breast cancer (Treatment): Your treatment options will depend on several factors, including the extent of the disease, its hormone receptor status, the type of treatment you received for your first breast cancer and your overall health. Your doctor also considers your goals and your preferences for treatment. Treating a local recurrence Treatment for a local recurrence typically starts with an operation and may include radiation if you haven&apost had it before. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy may also be recommended. - Surgery. For recurrent breast cancer that&aposs confined to the breast, treatment usually involves removing any remaining breast tissue. If your first cancer was treated with lumpectomy, your doctor may recommend a mastectomy to remove all of your breast tissue - lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, skin and nipple. If your first breast cancer was treated with mastectomy and the cancer comes back in the chest wall, you may have surgery to remove the new cancer along with a margin of normal tissue. A local recurrence may be accompanied by hidden cancer in nearby lymph nodes. For this reason, the surgeon may remove some or all of the nearby lymph nodes if they weren&apost removed during your initial treatment. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. If you didn&apost have radiation therapy for your first breast cancer, your doctor may recommend it now. But if you had radiation after a lumpectomy, radiation to treat the recurrence isn&apost usually recommended because of the risk of side effects. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to reduce your risk of another cancer recurrence. - Hormone therapy. Medications that block the growth-promoting effects of the hormones estrogen and progesterone may be recommended if your cancer is hormone receptor positive. Treating a regional recurrence Treatments for a regional breast cancer recurrence include: - Surgery. If it&aposs possible, surgery to remove the cancer is the recommended treatment for a regional recurrence. Your surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes under your arm if they&aposre still present. - Radiation therapy. Sometimes radiation therapy may be used after surgery. If surgery isn&apost possible, radiation therapy may be used as the main treatment for a regional breast cancer recurrence. - Drug treatments. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy or hormone therapy also may be recommended as the main treatment or may follow surgery or radiation. Treating a metastatic recurrence Many treatments exist for metastatic breast cancer. Your options will depend on where your cancer has spread. If one treatment doesn&apost work or stops working, you may be able to try other treatments. In general, the goal of treatment for a metastatic breast cancer isn&apost to cure the disease. Treatment may allow you to live longer and can help relieve symptoms the cancer is causing. Your doctor works to achieve a balance between controlling your symptoms while minimizing toxic effects from treatment. The aim is to help you live as well as possible for as long as possible. Treatments may include: - Hormone therapy. If your cancer is hormone receptor positive, you may benefit from hormone therapy. In general, hormone therapy has fewer side effects than chemotherapy, so in many cases it&aposs the first treatment used for metastatic breast cancer. - Chemotherapy. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy if your cancer is hormone receptor negative or if hormone therapy is no longer working. - Targeted therapy. If your cancer cells have certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to targeted therapy, your doctor may recommend these medications. - Bone-building drugs. If cancer has spread to your bones, your doctor may recommend a bone-building drug to reduce your risk of broken bones or reduce bone pain you may experience. - Other treatments. Radiation therapy and surgery may be used in certain situations to control signs and symptoms of advanced breast cancer.
1.0	Breast cancer at 84. My mother was just diagnost with breast cancer. She is 84 years old, her tumor started in the milk duct and is small in size, their is a mass as well in the same breast. He is scheduled for a lumpectomy to remove both. Because of age we would like suggestions on treatment options after surgery.	Breast cancer (Treatment): Treatment is based on many factors, including: - Type of breast cancer - Stage of the cancer (staging is a tool your providers use to find out how advanced the cancer is) - Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones - Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu protein Cancer treatments may include: - Hormone therapy. - Chemotherapy, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue. - Surgery to remove cancerous tissue: A lumpectomy removes the breast lump. Mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possibly nearby structures. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed during surgery. - Targeted therapy uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth. Cancer treatment can be local or systemic: - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast. - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment. Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured. - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment. - Stage I and II: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery. - Stage III: Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy. - Stage IV: Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment to monitor for the return of cancer or development of another breast cancer. Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later.
1.77777777778	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral neuropathy (Overview): Peripheral neuropathy, a result of damage to your peripheral nerves, often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in your hands and feet. It can also affect other areas of your body. Your peripheral nervous system sends information from your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to the rest of your body. Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes is diabetes mellitus. People with peripheral neuropathy generally describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling. In many cases, symptoms improve, especially if caused by a treatable condition. Medications can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy care at Mayo Clinic
-0.888888888889	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	How to diagnose Peripheral neuropathy?: The doctor or nurse will examine you and ask questions about your health history and symptoms. Blood tests may be done to look for causes of nerve damage. Your doctor may also recommend: - Electromyography-- to check activity in muscles - Nerve conduction studies-- to see how fast signals travel along nerves - Nerve biopsy-- to look at a sample of a nerve under a microscope
0.666666666667	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral neuropathy (Summary): Peripheral nerves carry information to and from the brain. They also carry signals to and from the spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy means these nerves don&apost work properly. Peripheral neuropathy may occur because of damage to a single nerve or a group of nerves. It may also affect nerves in the whole body.
2.0	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral Neuropathy (Definition): Peripheral neuropathy describes damage to the peripheral nervous system, which transmits information from the brain and spinal cord to every other part of the body. More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development, and prognosis. Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves -- motor, sensory, or autonomic -- that are damaged.  Some people may experience temporary numbness, tingling, and pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness. Others may suffer more extreme symptoms, including burning pain (especially at night), muscle wasting, paralysis, or organ or gland dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired. Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury (trauma) to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, medical procedures, and vascular and metabolic disorders. Acquired peripheral neuropathies are caused by systemic disease, trauma from external agents, or infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue. Inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy are caused by inborn mistakes in the genetic code or by new genetic mutations.
-0.555555555556	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral neuropathy (Treatment): Treatment goals are to manage the condition causing your neuropathy and to relieve symptoms. If your lab tests indicate no underlying condition, your doctor might recommend watchful waiting to see if your neuropathy improves. Medications Besides medications used to treat conditions associated with peripheral neuropathy, medications used to relieve peripheral neuropathy signs and symptoms include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can relieve mild symptoms. For more-severe symptoms, your doctor might prescribe painkillers. Medications containing opioids, such as tramadol (Conzip, Ultram) or oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others), can lead to dependence and addiction, so these drugs generally are prescribed only when other treatments fail. - Anti-seizure medications. Medications such as gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), developed to treat epilepsy, may relieve nerve pain. Side effects can include drowsiness and dizziness. - Topical treatments. Capsaicin cream, which contains a substance found in hot peppers, can cause modest improvements in peripheral neuropathy symptoms. You might have skin burning and irritation where you apply the cream, but this usually lessens over time. Some people, however, can&apost tolerate it. Lidocaine patches are another treatment you apply to your skin that might offer pain relief. Side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness and numbness at the site of the patch. - Antidepressants. Certain tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, doxepin and nortriptyline (Pamelor), have been found to help relieve pain by interfering with chemical processes in your brain and spinal cord that cause you to feel pain. The serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine (Cymbalta) and the extended-release antidepressant venlafaxine (Effexor XR) also might ease the pain of peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, decreased appetite and constipation. Therapies Various therapies and procedures might help ease the signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Electrodes placed on the skin deliver a gentle electric current at varying frequencies. TENS should be applied for 30 minutes daily for about a month. - Plasma exchange and intravenous immune globulin. These procedures, which help suppress immune system activity, might benefit people with certain inflammatory conditions. Plasma exchange involves removing your blood, then removing antibodies and other proteins from the blood and returning the blood to your body. In immune globulin therapy, you receive high levels of proteins that work as antibodies (immunoglobulins). - Physical therapy. If you have muscle weakness, physical therapy can help improve your movements. You may also need hand or foot braces, a cane, a walker, or a wheelchair. - Surgery. If you have neuropathies caused by pressure on nerves, such as pressure from tumors, you might need surgery to reduce the pressure.
-0.666666666667	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral neuropathy (Alternative medicine): Some people with peripheral neuropathy try complementary treatments for relief. Although researchers haven&apost studied these techniques as thoroughly as they have most medications, the following therapies have shown some promise: - Acupuncture. Inserting thin needles into various points on your body might reduce peripheral neuropathy symptoms. You might need multiple sessions before you notice improvement. Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed by a certified practitioner using sterile needles. - Alpha-lipoic acid. This has been used as a treatment for peripheral neuropathy in Europe for years. Discuss using alpha-lipoic acid with your doctor because it can affect blood sugar levels. Other side effects can include stomach upset and skin rash. - Herbs. Certain herbs, such as evening primrose oil, might help reduce neuropathy pain in people with diabetes. Some herbs interact with medications, so discuss herbs you&aposre considering with your doctor. - Amino acids. Amino acids, such as acetyl-L-carnitine, might benefit people who have undergone chemotherapy and people with diabetes. Side effects might include nausea and vomiting.
-0.444444444444	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral Neuropathy (Treatment): No medical treatments exist that can cure inherited peripheral neuropathy. However, there are therapies for many other forms.  In general, adopting healthy habits -- such as maintaining optimal weight, avoiding exposure to toxins, following a physician-supervised exercise program, eating a balanced diet, correcting vitamin deficiencies, and limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption -- can reduce the physical and emotional effects of peripheral neuropathy.  Systemic diseases frequently require more complex treatments.
-0.777777777778	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral neuropathy (Lifestyle and home remedies): To help you manage peripheral neuropathy: - Take care of your feet, especially if you have diabetes. Check daily for blisters, cuts or calluses. Wear soft, loose cotton socks and padded shoes. You can use a semicircular hoop, which is available in medical supply stores, to keep bedcovers off hot or sensitive feet. - Exercise. Regular exercise, such as walking three times a week, can reduce neuropathy pain, improve muscle strength and help control blood sugar levels. Gentle routines such as yoga and tai chi might also help. - Quit smoking. Cigarette smoking can affect circulation, increasing the risk of foot problems and other neuropathy complications. - Eat healthy meals. Good nutrition is especially important to ensure that you get essential vitamins and minerals. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein in your diet. - Avoid excessive alcohol. Alcohol can worsen peripheral neuropathy. - Monitor your blood glucose levels. If you have diabetes, this will help keep your blood glucose under control and might help improve your neuropathy.
1.88888888889	Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy What information does the National Library of Medicine have that states causes of peripheral neuropathy?	Peripheral neuropathy (Causes): Not a single disease, peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by a number of conditions. Causes of neuropathies include: - Alcoholism. Poor dietary choices made by people with alcoholism can lead to vitamin deficiencies. - Autoimmune diseases. These include Sjogren&aposs syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and necrotizing vasculitis. - Diabetes. More than half the people with diabetes develop some type of neuropathy. - Exposure to poisons. Toxic substances include heavy metals or chemicals. - Medications. Certain medications, especially those used to treat cancer (chemotherapy), can cause peripheral neuropathy. - Infections. These include certain viral or bacterial infections, including Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C, leprosy, diphtheria and HIV. - Inherited disorders. Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are hereditary types of neuropathy. - Trauma or pressure on the nerve. Traumas, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or sports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can result from having a cast or using crutches or repeating a motion such as typing many times. - Tumors. Growths, cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign), can develop on the nerves or press nerves. Also, polyneuropathy can arise as a result of some cancers related to the body&aposs immune response. These are a form of paraneoplastic syndrome. - Vitamin deficiencies. B vitamins - including B-1, B-6 and B-12 - vitamin E and niacin are crucial to nerve health. - Bone marrow disorders. These include abnormal protein in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies), a form of bone cancer (osteosclerotic myeloma), lymphoma and amyloidosis. - Other diseases. These include kidney disease, liver disease, connective tissue disorders and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). In a number of cases, no cause can be identified (idiopathic).

And how can i help her to get this cured..Please i really need your reply urgently	Pneumonia (Treatment): Treatment for pneumonia involves curing the infection and preventing complications. People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more. Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include: - Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don&apost improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic. - Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it&aposs a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest. - Fever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Hospitalization You may need to be hospitalized if: - You are older than age 65 - You are confused about time, people or places - Your kidney function has declined - Your systolic blood pressure is below 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or your diastolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg or below - Your breathing is rapid (30 breaths or more a minute) - You need breathing assistance - Your temperature is below normal - Your heart rate is below 50 or above 100 You may be admitted to the intensive care unit if you need to be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) or if your symptoms are severe. Children may be hospitalized if: - They are younger than age 2 months - They are lethargic or excessively sleepy - They have trouble breathing - They have low blood oxygen levels - They appear dehydrated

And how can i help her to get this cured..Please i really need your reply urgently	Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

DO NOT give aspirin to children because it may cause a dangerous illness called Reye syndrome. - DO NOT take cough medicines without first talking to your provider. Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up the extra sputum. - Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm. - Get a lot of rest. Have someone else do household chores. Antibiotics are used to treat atypical pneumonia. - You may be able to take antibiotics by mouth at home. - If your condition is severe, you will likely be admitted to a hospital. There, you will be given antibiotics through a vein (intravenously), as well as oxygen. - Antibiotics might be used for 2 weeks or more. - Finish all the antibiotics you&aposve been prescribed, even if you feel better. If you stop the medicine too soon, the pneumonia can return and may be harder to treat.

2.0	Cushing, fybromyaglia, Chronic fatigue my main concern is no treatment and the musclar distrophy effecting my heart, legs feet, shoulders, arms, etc.	Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as "fibro fog" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don&apost know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain&aposs pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person&aposs body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don&apost require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful.

Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren&apost new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven&apost been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body&aposs muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body&aposs natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms.

2.0	Cervical Cancer Can a long term untreated bladder infection aid in the cause of cervical cancer? And can the fact that my mom has cervical cancer aid in my chance of getting cervical cancer?	Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman&aposs sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman&aposs age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

I eat dinner around 8PM and nothing until the next morning.	Diabetes (Exams and Tests): A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes. Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. Blood tests: - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two different tests. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL (5.5 and 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher. - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a sugar drink (this test is used more often for type 2 diabetes). Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for: - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 3 years. - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors such as having high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister or brother with diabetes. - Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years.

I eat dinner around 8PM and nothing until the next morning.	Diabetes Type 2 (Summary): Summary Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older, obese, have a family history of diabetes, or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk. Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you may be able to delay or prevent developing it by making some lifestyle changes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly. Some people do not notice symptoms at all. The symptoms can include - Being very thirsty - Urinating often - Feeling very hungry or tired - Losing weight without trying - Having sores that heal slowly - Having blurry eyesight Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Diabetes type 2 - meal planning (Summary): When you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar and weight.
2.0	Diabetes Type 2 I test before going to bed and the reading is 94 but when I test again in the morning, the reading is 165. How can I lower it? I eat dinner around 8PM and nothing until the next morning.	Diabetes type 2 - meal planning (Function): Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has: - Food from all the food groups - Fewer calories - About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack - Healthy fats Along with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 to 60 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food. The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day). Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition. The following tips can help your child stay on track: - No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child&aposs blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range. - Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control. - Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. PLANNING MEALS Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices. A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate. EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. VEGETABLES (2½ to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day) Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable. FRUITS (1½ to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day) Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups. GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains: - Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. - Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice. Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6½ ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day) Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil. DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day) Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label. OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day) Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature. Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters). WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS? If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you. Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets: - Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others. - Eat sweets that are sugar-free. - Always ask for the smallest serving size or children&aposs size. YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you&aposre having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you.

0.5	Diabetes Type 2 I test before going to bed and the reading is 94 but when I test again in the morning, the reading is 165. How can I lower it? I eat dinner around 8PM and nothing until the next morning.	Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn&apost use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease. A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including: - Blurry vision - Excess thirst - Fatigue - Frequent urination - Hunger - Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed. After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include: - Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, and blindness - Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot - Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction - Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure - Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections - Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes. Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. Blood tests: - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two different tests. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL (5.5 and 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher. - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a sugar drink (this test is used more often for type 2 diabetes). Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for: - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 3 years. - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors such as having high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister or brother with diabetes. - Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years. Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level. Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator. Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke. To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider&aposs instructions on managing your diabetes. Many resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications. Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure. Tight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control. After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems: - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind. - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body. - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet. - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness. - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection. - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Keeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you&aposre overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight even helps. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes. At this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.

0.888888888889	My cousin she is leber amaurosis she need help I don&apost know where to start from	Leber congenital amaurosis: Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time. Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus. A specific behavior called Franceschetti&aposs oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children. In rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However, researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms. At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities. Leber congenital amaurosis occurs in 2 to 3 per 100,000 newborns. It is one of the most common causes of blindness in children. Leber congenital amaurosis can result from mutations in at least 14 genes, all of which are necessary for normal vision. These genes play a variety of roles in the development and function of the retina. For example, some of the genes associated with this disorder are necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Other genes are involved in phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Still other genes play a role in the function of cilia, which are microscopic finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. Cilia are necessary for the perception of several types of sensory input, including vision. Mutations in any of the genes associated with Leber congenital amaurosis disrupt the development and function of the retina, resulting in early vision loss. Mutations in the CEP290, CRB1, GUCY2D, and RPE65 genes are the most common causes of the disorder, while mutations in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases. In about 30 percent of all people with Leber congenital amaurosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Leber congenital amaurosis usually has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. When Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in the CRX or IMPDH1 genes, the disorder has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person inherits a gene mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

Management of affected individuals is usually supportive, with provision of visual aids. [2] High-dose oral idebenone may be considered as a treatment option, especially for individuals with LHON with relatively recent disease onset. Some studies have reported a benefit from using idebenone with quinone analogues, such as ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) and with vitamin C and vitamin B12. [2] In an open-label study of five individuals with acute LHON treated within 90 days of disease onset, the antioxidant α-tocotrienol-quinone (EPI-743), a vitamin E derivative, showed good results. [2] Those with established LHON mitochondrial DNA mutations are advised not to smoke and to limit their alcohol intake. People with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy may also find it helpful to speak with other affected individuals and to seek extra psychosocial or counseling support.

Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

-1.77777777778	My cousin she is leber amaurosis she need help I don&apost know where to start from	Generalized anxiety disorder - self-care (Therapy): Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist and in a safe place. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it. Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people&aposs behavior or life events. - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones. Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.

When amaurosis fugax is due to a blood clot or plaque, the concern is to prevent a stroke. The following can help prevent a stroke: - Avoid fatty foods and follow a healthy, low-fat diet. DO NOT drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day. - Exercise regularly: 30 minutes a day if you are not overweight; 60 to 90 minutes a day if you are overweight. - Quit smoking. - Most people should aim for a blood pressure below 120 to 130/80 mm Hg. If you have diabetes or have had a stroke, your doctor may tell you to aim for a lower blood pressure. - If you have diabetes, heart disease, or hardening of the arteries, your LDL "bad" cholesterol should be lower than 70 mg/dL. - Follow your doctor&aposs treatment plans if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease. Your doctor may also recommend: - No treatment. You may only need regular visits to check the health of your heart and carotid arteries. - Aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or other blood-thinning drugs to lower your risk of stroke. If a large part of the carotid artery appears blocked, carotid endarterectomy surgery is done to remove the blockage. The decision to do surgery is also based on your overall health.

Started off at night but now happening through the day my back and neck and voice box are also effected and my chest area has now seized to the point of restricting my breathing to very shallow at times I find that I am stretching out involuntarily right through my body and this is becoming more frequent	Stiff-Person Syndrome: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease.  SPS is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms.  Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder.  People with SPS can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls.  SPS affects twice as many women as men.   It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia.  Scientists don’t yet understand what causes SPS, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.  The disorder is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, psychosomatic illness, or anxiety and phobia.  A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies in the blood.  People with SPS have elevated levels of GAD, an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain. People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine.  A recent study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and stress in people with SPS.  Treatment with IVIg, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and pain relievers will improve the symptoms of SPS, but will not cure the disorder.  Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe.  With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Stroke 5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebral aneurysm - Hematuria - Leukoencephalopathy - Muscle cramps - Nephropathy - Renal cyst - Renal insufficiency - Retinal arteriolar tortuosity - Retinal hemorrhage - Supraventricular arrhythmia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.

2.0	congenital diaphragmatic hernia I need to know if CDH can be passed down to future generations. I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971. I was then told it was merely a fluke. I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health. Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in 2015. Does the term &aposcongenital&apos mean that it could be passed down to another generation? I do not want to alarm my son and his wife. I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience. Unfortunately my son and I are estranged. And I do not know who is their pediatrician. My child&aposs CDH was very severe. I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition. Please respond to my concerns.	congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

Do you have information about Diaphragmatic hernia repair - congenital: Summary : Diaphragmatic hernia repair is surgery to correct an opening or space in a baby&aposs diaphragm. This opening is called a hernia. It is a rare type of birth defect. (Congenital means the problem is present at birth.) Description : Before this surgery, nearly all infants need a breathing device to improve their oxygen levels. The surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia (asleep and not able to feel pain). The surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the belly under the upper ribs. This allows the organs in the area to be reached. The surgeon gently pulls these organs down into place through the opening in the diaphragm and into the abdominal cavity. The surgeon repairs the hole in the diaphragm. If the hole is small, it may be repaired with stitches. In most cases, a piece of plastic patch is used to cover the hole. Why the Procedure is Performed : The diaphragm is a muscle. It is important for breathing. It separates the chest cavity (where the heart and lungs are) from the belly area. In a child born with a diaphragmatic hernia, the diaphragm muscle is not completely formed. So, organs from the belly (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines) may go up into the chest cavity where the lungs are. This prevents the lung(s) from growing normally. The lungs stay too small for babies to breathe on their own when they are born. A diaphragmatic hernia can be life-threatening. Surgery to repair it must be done in the first few days or weeks of a child&aposs life. Risks : Risks for this surgery include: - Breathing problems, which may be severe - Bleeding - Collapsed lung - Lung problems that do not go away - Infection - Reactions to medicines Before the Procedure : Infants with a diaphragmatic hernia are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). It may be days or weeks before the baby is stable enough for surgery. - In the NICU, your baby will probably need a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) before the surgery. This helps the baby breathe. - If your child is very sick, a heart-lung bypass machine (ECMO) may be needed to do the work of the heart and lungs. - Before surgery, your baby will have x-rays and regular blood tests to see how well the lungs are working. A light sensor (called a pulse oximeter) is taped to baby&aposs skin to monitor the oxygen level in the blood. - Your baby may be given medicines to control blood pressure and keep him or her comfortable. Your baby will have tubes placed: - From the mouth or nose to the stomach to keep air out of the stomach - In an artery to monitor blood pressure - In a vein to deliver nutrients and medicines After the Procedure : Your baby will be on a breathing machine after the surgery and will stay in the hospital for several weeks. Once the baby is taken off the breathing machine, they may still need oxygen and some medicine for a while. Feedings will start after your baby&aposs bowels start working. Feedings are usually given through a small, soft feeding tube from the mouth or nose into the stomach or small intestines until your baby can take all the milk they need by mouth. Most infants with diaphragmatic hernias have reflux when they eat. This means the food or acid in their stomach moves up into their esophagus, the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach. This can be uncomfortable for your baby. It also leads to frequent spitting up, vomiting, and pneumonia, which makes feedings more difficult once your baby is taking food by mouth. The nurses and feeding specialists will teach you ways to hold and feed your baby to prevent reflux. Some babies need to be on a feeding tube for a long time to get enough food to grow. Outlook (Prognosis) : The outcome of this surgery depends on how well your baby&aposs lungs have developed. Some babies have other medical problems, including problems with the brain, muscles, and joints, which may slow recovery. Usually, the outlook is good for infants who have well-developed lung tissue. Most babies who are born with a diaphragmatic hernia are very ill and will stay in the hospital for a long time. With advances in medicine, the outlook for these infants is gradually improving. All babies who have had diaphragmatic hernia repairs will need to be watched closely to make sure the hole in their diaphragm does not open up again as they grow. Babies who had a large opening or defect in the diaphragm, or who had more problems with their lungs after birth, may have lung disease after they leave the hospital. They may need oxygen, medicines, and a feeding tube for months or years. Some babies will have problems crawling, walking, talking, and eating. They will need to see physical or occupational therapists to help them develop muscles and strength.
0.666666666667	congenital diaphragmatic hernia I need to know if CDH can be passed down to future generations. I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971. I was then told it was merely a fluke. I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health. Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in 2015. Does the term &aposcongenital&apos mean that it could be passed down to another generation? I do not want to alarm my son and his wife. I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience. Unfortunately my son and I are estranged. And I do not know who is their pediatrician. My child&aposs CDH was very severe. I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition. Please respond to my concerns.	congenital diaphragmatic hernia (Genetic Changes): Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified.
2.0	Colon cancer cure seen on tv. My father has colon cancer and said he saw a commercial on tv about a cure for colon cancer. He cannot remember any details about it. I was wondering if you know anything about something like this. Please let me know. Thank you,	Colon cancer (Treatment): The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can&apost be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it&aposs not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn&apost done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.

I was wondering if you know anything about something like this. Please let me know. Thank you,	Understanding your colon cancer risk (How to Reduce Your Risk): Some risk factors are in your control, and some are not. Many of the risk factors above, such as age and family history, can&apost be changed. But just because you have risk factors you can&apost control doesn&apost mean you can&apost take steps to lower your risk. Start by getting colon cancer screenings starting at age 50. You may want to start screening earlier if you have a family history. Screening can help prevent colon cancer, and it is one of the best things you can do to lower your risk. Certain lifestyle habits also may help lower your risk: - Maintain a healthy weight - Eat a low-fat foods with plenty of vegetables and fruits - Limit red meat and processed meat - Get regular exercise - Limit alcohol to no more than 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men - DO NOT smoke You can also have genetic testing done to assess your risk for colon cancer. If you have a strong family history of the disease, talk with your health care provider about testing. Low-dose aspirin may be recommended for some people who are at very high risk for colon cancer found with genetic testing. It is NOT recommended for most people because of side effects.
1.83333333333	Colon cancer cure seen on tv. My father has colon cancer and said he saw a commercial on tv about a cure for colon cancer. He cannot remember any details about it. I was wondering if you know anything about something like this. Please let me know. Thank you,	Colon cancer: Colon cancer is cancer of the large intestine (colon), which is the final part of your digestive tract. Most cases of colon cancer begin as small, noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called adenomatous polyps. Over time some of these polyps can become colon cancers. Polyps may be small and produce few, if any, symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to help prevent colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they turn into cancer. Signs and symptoms of colon cancer include: - A change in your bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation or a change in the consistency of your stool, that lasts longer than four weeks - Rectal bleeding or blood in your stool - Persistent abdominal discomfort, such as cramps, gas or pain - A feeling that your bowel doesn&apost empty completely - Weakness or fatigue - Unexplained weight loss Many people with colon cancer experience no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. When symptoms appear, they&aposll likely vary, depending on the cancer&aposs size and location in your large intestine. When to see a doctor If you notice any symptoms of colon cancer, such as blood in your stool or an ongoing change in bowel habits, do not hesitate to make an appointment with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about when you should begin screening for colon cancer. Guidelines generally recommend that colon cancer screenings begin at age 50. Your doctor may recommend more frequent or earlier screening if you have other risk factors, such as a family history of the disease. In most cases, it&aposs not clear what causes colon cancer. Doctors know that colon cancer occurs when healthy cells in the colon develop errors in their genetic blueprint, the DNA. Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally. But when a cell&aposs DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide - even when new cells aren&apost needed. As the cells accumulate, they form a tumor. With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby. And cancerous cells can travel to other parts of the body to form deposits there (metastasis). Inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of colon cancer Inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of colon cancer can be passed through families, but these inherited genes are linked to only a small percentage of colon cancers. Inherited gene mutations don&apost make cancer inevitable, but they can increase an individual&aposs risk of cancer significantly. The most common forms of inherited colon cancer syndromes are: - Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). HNPCC, also called Lynch syndrome, increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers. People with HNPCC tend to develop colon cancer before age 50. - Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a rare disorder that causes you to develop thousands of polyps in the lining of your colon and rectum. People with untreated FAP have a greatly increased risk of developing colon cancer before age 40. FAP, HNPCC and other, rarer inherited colon cancer syndromes can be detected through genetic testing. If you&aposre concerned about your family&aposs history of colon cancer, talk to your doctor about whether your family history suggests you have a risk of these conditions. Association between diet and increased colon cancer risk Studies of large groups of people have shown an association between a typical Western diet and an increased risk of colon cancer. A typical Western diet is high in fat and low in fiber. When people move from areas where the typical diet is low in fat and high in fiber to areas where the typical Western diet is most common, the risk of colon cancer in these people increases significantly. It&aposs not clear why this occurs, but researchers are studying whether a high-fat, low-fiber diet affects the microbes that live in the colon or causes underlying inflammation that may contribute to cancer risk. This is an area of active investigation and research is ongoing. Factors that may increase your risk of colon cancer include: - Older age. The great majority of people diagnosed with colon cancer are older than 50. Colon cancer can occur in younger people, but it occurs much less frequently. - African-American race. African-Americans have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races. - A personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps. If you&aposve already had colon cancer or adenomatous polyps, you have a greater risk of colon cancer in the future. - Inflammatory intestinal conditions. Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn&aposs disease, can increase your risk of colon cancer. - Inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk. Genetic syndromes passed through generations of your family can increase your risk of colon cancer. These syndromes include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, which is also known as Lynch syndrome. - Family history of colon cancer. You&aposre more likely to develop colon cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with the disease. If more than one family member has colon cancer or rectal cancer, your risk is even greater. - Low-fiber, high-fat diet. Colon cancer and rectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in fiber and high in fat and calories. Research in this area has had mixed results. Some studies have found an increased risk of colon cancer in people who eat diets high in red meat and processed meat. - A sedentary lifestyle. If you&aposre inactive, you&aposre more likely to develop colon cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of colon cancer. - Diabetes. People with diabetes and insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer. - Obesity. People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer and an increased risk of dying of colon cancer when compared with people considered normal weight. - Smoking. People who smoke may have an increased risk of colon cancer. - Alcohol. Heavy use of alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer. - Radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers increases the risk of colon and rectal cancer. Screening for colon cancer Doctors recommend certain screening tests for healthy people with no signs or symptoms in order to look for early colon cancer. Finding colon cancer at its earliest stage provides the greatest chance for a cure. Screening has been shown to reduce your risk of dying of colon cancer. People with an average risk of colon cancer can consider screening beginning at age 50. But people with an increased risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer, should consider screening sooner. African-Americans and American Indians may consider beginning colon cancer screening at age 45. Several screening options exist - each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Talk about your options with your doctor, and together you can decide which tests are appropriate for you. If a colonoscopy is used for screening, polyps can be removed during the procedure before they turn into cancer. Diagnosing colon cancer If your signs and symptoms indicate that you could have colon cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more tests and procedures, including: - Using a scope to examine the inside of your colon. Colonoscopy uses a long, flexible and slender tube attached to a video camera and monitor to view your entire colon and rectum. If any suspicious areas are found, your doctor can pass surgical tools through the tube to take tissue samples (biopsies) for analysis and remove polyps. - Blood tests. No blood test can tell you if you have colon cancer. But your doctor may test your blood for clues about your overall health, such as kidney and liver function tests. Your doctor may also test your blood for a chemical sometimes produced by colon cancers (carcinoembryonic antigen or CEA). Tracked over time, the level of CEA in your blood may help your doctor understand your prognosis and whether your cancer is responding to treatment. Staging colon cancer Once you&aposve been diagnosed with colon cancer, your doctor will order tests to determine the extent (stage) of your cancer. Staging helps determine what treatments are most appropriate for you. Staging tests may include imaging procedures such as abdominal, pelvic and chest CT scans. In many cases, the stage of your cancer may not be determined until after colon cancer surgery. The stages of colon cancer are: - Stage I. The cancer has grown through the superficial lining (mucosa) of the colon or rectum but hasn&apost spread beyond the colon wall or rectum. - Stage II. The cancer has grown into or through the wall of the colon or rectum but hasn&apost spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage III. The cancer has invaded nearby lymph nodes but isn&apost affecting other parts of your body yet. - Stage IV. The cancer has spread to distant sites, such as other organs - for instance, to your liver or lung. The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy.

2.0	diarrhea i had bad diarrhea over the weekend and though how my mother used paregoric, went to the drug store to get some, he said they dont sell it any more HELP	Diarrhea (Treatment): Most cases of diarrhea clear on their own within a couple of days without treatment. If you&aposve tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments. Antibiotics Antibiotics might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won&apost help. Treatment to replace fluids Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes diarrhea, your doctor might recommend getting fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn&apost contain the salts and electrolytes - minerals such as sodium and potassium - you need to maintain the electric currents that keep your heart beating. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. Certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse. For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids. Adjusting medications you&aposre taking If your doctor determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, your doctor might lower your dose or switch to another medication. Treating underlying conditions If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will work to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you.

Treating the chronic diarrhea is often the biggest concern, as chronic diarrhea can prevent people with trichohepatoenteric syndrome from getting enough nutrients. In most cases, treatment requires nutrition through an intravenous line, or IV. This is also called parenteral nutrition. [1] If the liver disease associated with trichohepatoenteric syndrome permanently damages the liver, a partial or complete liver transplant may be required. [2] It may also be necessary to treat the weakened immune system associated with trichohepatoenteric syndrome. People with the condition may need treatment such as immunoglobulin infusions to boost the immune system. [4]

The goal of treatment is to make you feel better and avoid dehydration. Getting enough fluids and learning what to eat will help keep you or your child comfortable. You may need to: - Manage the diarrhea - Control nausea and vomiting - Get plenty of rest You can drink oral rehydration mixtures to replace fluids and minerals lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Oral rehydration powder can be purchased from a pharmacy. Be sure to mix the powder in safe water. You can make your own rehydration mixture by dissolving one half teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, one half teaspoon (2.5 grams) of baking soda and 4 tablespoons (50 grams) of sugar in 4 ¼ cups (1 liter) of water. You may need to get fluids through a vein (IV) if you have diarrhea or vomiting and cannot drink or keep enough fluids in your body. You will need to go to your provider&aposs office or the emergency room. If you take diuretics (water pills), talk to your provider. You may need to stop taking the diuretic while you have diarrhea. Never stop or change medicines without first talking to your provider. You can buy medicines at the drugstore that can help stop or slow diarrhea. Do not use these medicines without talking to your provider if you have bloody diarrhea or a fever. Do not give these medicines to children.

[3] Studies have shown that early diagnosis and aggressive salt replacement therapy (replacing sodium and chloride, the 2 things that make up salt) are associated with normal growth and development, in addition to reduced mortality rates. [3] In individuals with this condition, the goal is for the oral intake of chloride, sodium, and potassium to be greater than the amount lost through the feces (i.e., there must be a positive gastrointestinal balance) so that losses in sweat can be replaced. [4] Replacement therapy with NaCl (sodium chloride) and KCl (potassium chloride) has been shown to be effective in children. [3] One study showed that a medication called omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, reduces electrolyte losses in individuals and thus promotes a positive gastrointestinal balance. However, this treatment does not reduce the need for careful monitoring of dietary intake, electrolyte concentrations, and urinary chloride loss. [4] Another study discussed how butyrate could be effective in treating the condition, and that it is easily administered, useful in preventing severe dehydration episodes, and may be a promising approach for a long-term treatment.

0.8	Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am doing a research project on this genetic disease and I would like to know more about it from a professional. I am researching the mode of inheritance, symptoms, treatments/ support groups, and relative cost to family.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Causes): Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy. It worsens quickly. Other muscular dystrophies (including Becker&aposs muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition. The condition most often affects boys due to the way the disease is inherited. The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
2.0	Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am doing a research project on this genetic disease and I would like to know more about it from a professional. I am researching the mode of inheritance, symptoms, treatments/ support groups, and relative cost to family.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells (neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is  inherited in an X-linked recessive  pattern; however, it may also occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]  While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).  Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being  Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.   The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]  DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]  Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]  Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a " carrier ". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child&aposs doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for  increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]   Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]  Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life. An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a  heart transplant may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids ( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone  is a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

2.0	I am looking for information about Cancer of the Esophagus and I&aposm not finding anything on your website.	Esophageal cancer: Esophageal cancer is cancer that starts in the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made. - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus: - DO NOT smoke - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

Do you have information about D and C: Summary : D and C is a procedure to scrape and collect the tissue (endometrium) from inside the uterus. - Dilation ("D") is a widening of the cervix to allow instruments into the uterus. - Curettage ("C") is the scraping of the walls of the uterus. Description : D and C, also called uterine scraping, may be performed in the hospital or in a clinic while you are under general or local anesthesia. The health care provider will insert an instrument called a speculum into the vagina. This holds open the vaginal canal. Numbing medicine may be applied to the opening to the uterus (cervix). The cervical canal is widened, and a curette (a metal loop on the end of a long, thin handle) is passed through the opening into the uterus cavity. The health care provider gently scrapes the inner layer of tissue, called the endometrium. The tissue is collected for examination. Why the Procedure is Performed : This procedure may be done to: - Diagnose or rule out conditions such as uterine cancer - Remove tissue after a miscarriage - Treat heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular periods, or bleeding between periods - Perform a therapeutic or elective abortion Your health care provider may also recommend a D and C if you have: - Abnormal bleeding while you are on hormone replacement therapy - An embedded intrauterine device (IUD) - Bleeding after menopause - Endometrial polyps (small lumps of tissue on the endometrium) - Thickening of the uterus This list may not include all possible reasons for a D and C. Risks : Risks related to D and C include: - Puncture of the uterus - Scarring of the uterine lining (Asherman syndrome, may lead to infertility later) - Tear of the cervix Risks due to anesthesia include: - Reactions to medications - Problems breathing Risks of any surgery include: - Bleeding - Infection After the Procedure : A D and C has few risks. It can provide relief from bleeding, and can help diagnose infection, cancer, and other diseases. You may return to your normal activities as soon as you feel better, possibly even the same day. You may have vaginal bleeding, pelvic cramps, and back pain for a few days after the procedure. You can usually manage pain well with medications. Avoid using tampons and having sexual intercourse for 1 - 2 weeks after the procedure.

Esophageal cancer: Esophageal cancer is a cancer of the esophagus, the hollow tube that carries food and liquids from the throat to the stomach. As the cancer grows, symptoms may include painful or difficult swallowing, weight loss and coughing up blood. The exact cause is usually not known, but both environmental and genetic factors are throught to play a role in the development of this condition. In the United States, risk factors for developing esophageal cancer include smoking, heavy drinking, obesity, and damage from acid reflux.

-0.571428571429	I am looking for information about Cancer of the Esophagus and I&aposm not finding anything on your website.	Esophagectomy - minimally invasive: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is surgery to remove part or all of the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach. After it is removed, the esophagus is rebuilt from part of your stomach or part of your large intestine. Most of the time, esophagectomy is done to treat cancer of the esophagus. The surgery may also be done to treat the esophagus if it is no longer working to move food into the stomach. During minimally invasive esophagectomy, small surgical cuts (incisions) are made in your upper belly, chest, or neck. A viewing scope (laparoscope) and surgical tools are inserted through the incisions to perform the surgery. (Removal of the esophagus can also be done using the open method. Surgery is done through larger incisions.) Laparoscopic surgery is generally done in the following way: - You&aposll receive general anesthesia at the time of your surgery. This will keep you asleep and pain-free. - The surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in your upper belly, chest, or lower neck. These cuts are about 1-inch (2.5 cm) long. - The laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts into your upper belly. The scope has a light and camera on the end. Video from the camera appears on a monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the area being operated on. Other surgical tools are inserted through the other cuts. - The surgeon frees the esophagus from nearby tissues. Depending on how much of your esophagus is diseased, part or most of it is removed. - If part of your esophagus is removed, the remaining ends are joined together using staples or stitches. If most of your esophagus is removed, the surgeon reshapes your stomach into a tube to make a new esophagus. It is joined to the remaining part of the esophagus. - During surgery, lymph nodes in your chest and belly are likely removed if cancer has spread to them. - A feeding tube is placed in your small intestine so that you can be fed while you are recovering from surgery. Some medical centers do this operation using robotic surgery. In this type of surgery, a small scope and other instruments are inserted through the small cuts in the skin. The surgeon controls the scope and instruments while sitting at a computer station and viewing a monitor. Surgery usually takes 3 to 6 hours. The most common reason for removing part, or all, of your esophagus is to treat cancer. You may also have radiation therapy or chemotherapy before or after surgery. Surgery to remove the lower esophagus may also be done to treat: - A condition in which the ring of muscle in the esophagus does not work well (achalasia) - Severe damage of the lining of the esophagus that can lead to cancer (Barrett esophagus) - Severe trauma This is major surgery and has many risks. Some of them are serious. Be sure to discuss these risks with your surgeon. Risks for this surgery, or for problems after surgery, may be higher than normal if you: - Are unable to walk even for short distances (this increases the risk for blood clots, lung problems, and pressure sores) - Are older than 60 to 65 - Are a heavy smoker - Are obese - Have lost a lot of weight from your cancer - Are on steroid medicines - Had cancer drugs before the surgery Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are: - Allergic reactions to medicines - Breathing problems - Bleeding, blood clots, or infection Risks for this surgery are: - Acid reflux - Injury to the stomach, intestines, lungs, or other organs during surgery - Leakage of the contents of your esophagus or stomach where the surgeon joined them together - Narrowing of the connection between your stomach and esophagus - Pneumonia You will have many doctor visits and medical tests before you have surgery. Some of these are: - A complete physical examination - Visits with your doctor to make sure other medical problems you may have, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems, are under control - Nutritional counseling - A visit or class to learn what happens during surgery, what you should expect afterward, and what risks or problems may occur afterward. - If you have recently lost weight, your doctor may put you on oral or IV nutrition for several weeks before surgery. - CT scan to look at the esophagus. - PET scan to identify the cancer and if it has spread. - Endoscopy to diagnose and identify how far the cancer has gone. If you are a smoker, you should stop several weeks before surgery. Ask your health care provider for help. Tell your provider: - If you are or might be pregnant - What medicines, vitamins, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription - If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day. During the week before surgery: - You may be asked to stop taking blood thinner drugs. Some of these are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and clopidogrel (Plavix), or ticlopidine (Ticlid). - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery. - Prepare your home for after surgery. On the day of surgery: - DO NOT eat or drink anything after the midnight before surgery. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Arrive at the hospital on time. Most people stay in the hospital for 7 to 14 days after an esophagectomy. How long you stay will depend on what type of surgery you had. You may spend 1 to 3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) right after surgery. During your hospital stay, you will: - Be asked to sit on the side of your bed and walk on the same day or day after surgery. - Not be able to eat for at least the first 2 to 7 days after surgery. After that, you may be able to start with liquids. You will be fed through a feeding tube that was placed into your intestine during surgery. - Have a tube coming out of the side of your chest to drain fluids that build up. - Wear special stockings on your feet and legs to prevent blood clots. - Receive shots to prevent blood clots. - Receive pain medicine through an IV or take pills. You may receive your pain medicine through a special pump. With this pump, you press a button to deliver pain medicine when you need it. This allows you to control the amount of pain medicine you get. - Do breathing exercises. After you go home, follow instructions on how to take care of yourself as you heal. You&aposll be given information on diet and eating. Be sure to follow those instructions as well. Many people recover well from this surgery and can have a fairly normal diet. After they recover they will likely need to eat smaller portions and eat more often. If you had the surgery for cancer, talk with your doctor about the next steps to treat the cancer.

Photodynamic therapy for cancer: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a medicine together with a special type of light to kill cancer cells. First, the doctors injects a medicine that is absorbed by cells all over the body. The drug stays in cancer cells longer than it stays in normal, healthy cells. After 1 to 3 days, the medicine is gone from the healthy cells, but remains in the cancer cells. Then, the doctor directs light at the cancer cells using a laser or other light source. The light triggers the medicine to produce a type of oxygen that treats cancer by: - Killing cancer cells - Damaging blood cells in the tumor - Helping the body&aposs infection-fighting system attack the tumor The light can come from a laser or other source. The light is often applied through a thin, lighted tube that is put inside the body. Small fibers at the end of the tube direct the light at the cancer cells. PDT treats cancer in the: - Lungs, using a bronchoscope - Esophagus, using upper endoscopy Doctors use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to treat skin cancers. Medicine is placed on the skin, and the light is shone on the skin. Another type of PDT uses a machine to collect a person&aposs blood, which is then treated with a drug and exposed to light. Then, the blood is returned to the person. This is used to treat symptoms of a certain type of lymphoma. PDT has several benefits. For example, it: - Targets only cancer cells, not normal cells - Can be repeated many times in the same area, unlike radiation therapy - Is less risky than surgery - Takes less time and costs less than many other cancer treatments But PDT also has drawbacks. It can only treat areas where light can reach. That means it can only be used to treat cancer on or just under the skin, or in the linings of some organs. Also, it cannot be used in people with certain blood diseases. There are two main side effects of PDT. One is a reaction caused by light that makes the skin swollen, sunburned, or blistered after just a few minutes in the sun or near bright lights. This reaction can last as long as 3 months after treatment. To avoid it: - Close the shades and curtains on windows and skylights in your home before you get your treatment. - Bring dark sunglasses, gloves, a wide-brimmed hat, and wear clothes that cover as much of your skin as possible to your treatment. - For at least a month after treatment, stay inside as much as possible, especially between 10 am and 4 pm. - Cover your skin whenever you go outside, even on cloudy days and in the car. DO NOT count on sunscreen, it will not prevent the reaction. - DO NOT use reading lamps and avoid exam lamps, such as the type a dentist uses. - DO NOT use helmet-type hair dryers like those in hair salons. Use only the low heat setting when using a hand-held hair dryer. The other main side effect is swelling, which may cause pain or trouble breathing or swallowing. These depend on the area that is treated. The side effects are temporary. Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

Thanks	What is Hernia?: A hernia is a sac formed by the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). The sac comes through a hole or weak area in the strong layer of the belly wall that surrounds the muscle. This layer is called the fascia. Which type of hernia you have depends on where it is: - Femoral hernia is a bulge in the upper thigh, just below the groin. This type is more common in women than men. - Hiatal hernia occurs in the upper part of the stomach. Part of the upper stomach pushes into the chest. - Incisional hernia can occur through a scar if you have had abdominal surgery in the past. - Umbilical hernia is a bulge around the belly button. It occurs when the muscle around the belly button does not close completely after birth. - Inguinal hernia is a bulge in the groin. It is more common in men. It may go all the way down into the scrotum.
2.0	I have an hernia I would love to take care off it ASAP I was wondering if you guys could help me . Thanks	Hernia (Treatment): Surgery is the only treatment that can permanently fix a hernia. Surgery may be more risky for people with serious medical problems. Surgery repairs the weakened abdominal wall tissue (fascia) and closes any holes. Most hernias are closed with stitches and sometimes with mesh patches to plug the hole. An umbilical hernia that does not heal on its own by the time a child is 5 years old will likely be repaired.
-0.888888888889	I have an hernia I would love to take care off it ASAP I was wondering if you guys could help me . Thanks	What is Hernia?: A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen. There are several types of hernias, including - Inguinal, in the groin. This is the the most common type. - Umbilical, around the belly button - Incisional, through a scar - Hiatal, a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest. - Congenital diaphragmatic, a birth defect that needs surgery Hernias are common. They can affect men, women, and children. A combination of muscle weakness and straining, such as with heavy lifting, might contribute. Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get a hernia. Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.

Thanks	Hiatal hernia (Treatment): Most people with a hiatal hernia don&apost experience any signs or symptoms and won&apost need treatment. If you experience signs and symptoms, such as recurrent heartburn and acid reflux, you may need medication or surgery. Medications If you experience heartburn and acid reflux, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems. - Medications to reduce acid production. These medications - known as H-2-receptor blockers - include cimetidine (Tagamet famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid ) and ranitidine (Zantac). Stronger versions are available by prescription. - Medications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications - known as proton pump inhibitors - are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid). Stronger versions are available in prescription form. Surgery Sometimes a hiatal hernia requires surgery. Surgery is generally used for people who aren&apost helped by medications to relieve heartburn and acid reflux, or have complications such as severe inflammation or narrowing of the esophagus. Surgery to repair a hiatal hernia may involve pulling your stomach down into your abdomen and making the opening in your diaphragm smaller, reconstructing an esophageal sphincter or removing the hernia sac. Or your surgeon may insert a tiny camera and special surgical tools through several small incisions in your abdomen. The operation is then performed while your surgeon views images from inside your body that are displayed on a video monitor (laparoscopic surgery). Sometimes surgery is done using a single incision in your chest wall (thoracotomy).

Thanks	Diaphragmatic hernia (Treatment): A diaphragmatic hernia repair is an emergency that requires surgery. Surgery is done to place the abdominal organs into the proper position and repair the opening in the diaphragm. The infant will need breathing support during the recovery period. Some infants are placed on a heart/lung bypass machine to help deliver enough oxygen to the body. If a diaphragmatic hernia is diagnosed early during pregnancy (before 24 to 28 weeks), fetal surgery may be an option in some situations.
0.666666666667	I have an hernia I would love to take care off it ASAP I was wondering if you guys could help me . Thanks	Inguinal hernia (Treatment): If your hernia is small and isn&apost bothering you, your doctor might recommend watchful waiting. In children, the doctor might try applying manual pressure to reduce the bulge before considering surgery. Enlarging or painful hernias usually require surgery to relieve discomfort and prevent serious complications. There are two general types of hernia operations - open hernia repair and laparoscopic repair. Open hernia repair In this procedure, which might be done with local anesthesia and sedation or general anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision in your groin and pushes the protruding tissue back into your abdomen. The surgeon then sews the weakened area, often reinforcing it with a synthetic mesh (hernioplasty). The opening is then closed with stitches, staples or surgical glue. After the surgery, you&aposll be encouraged to move about as soon as possible, but it might be several weeks before you&aposre able to resume normal activities. Laparoscopy In this minimally invasive procedure, which requires general anesthesia, the surgeon operates through several small incisions in your abdomen. Gas is used to inflate your abdomen to make the internal organs easier to see. A small tube equipped with a tiny camera (laparoscope) is inserted into one incision. Guided by the camera, the surgeon inserts tiny instruments through other incisions to repair the hernia using synthetic mesh. People who have laparoscopic repair might have less discomfort and scarring after surgery and a quicker return to normal activities. However, some studies indicate that hernia recurrence is more likely with laparoscopic repair than with open surgery. Laparoscopy allows the surgeon to avoid scar tissue from an earlier hernia repair, so it might be a good choice for people whose hernias recur after traditional hernia surgery. It also might be a good choice for people with hernias on both sides of the body (bilateral). Some studies indicate that a laparoscopic repair can increase the risk of complications and of recurrence. Having the procedure performed by a surgeon with extensive experience in laparoscopic hernia repairs can reduce the risks.

Thanks	Umbilical hernia (Treatment): Most umbilical hernias in babies close on their own by age 1 or 2. Your doctor may even be able to push the bulge back into the abdomen during a physical exam. Don&apost try this on your own, however. Although some people claim a hernia can be fixed by taping a coin down over the bulge, this "fix" doesn&apost help and germs may accumulate under the tape, causing infection. For children, surgery is typically reserved for umbilical hernias that: - Are painful - Are bigger than 1.5 centimeters in diameter (slightly larger than a 1/2 inch) - Are large and don&apost decrease in size over the first two years - Don&apost disappear by age 4 - Become trapped or block the intestines For adults, surgery is typically recommended to avoid possible complications - especially if the umbilical hernia gets bigger or becomes painful. During surgery, a small incision is made at the base of the bellybutton. The herniated tissue is returned to the abdominal cavity, and the opening in the abdominal wall is stitched closed. In adults, surgeons often use mesh to help strengthen the abdominal wall.
0.333333333333	I have an hernia I would love to take care off it ASAP I was wondering if you guys could help me . Thanks	Hiatal hernia: Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen. The exact cause of hiatal hernia is unknown. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age, obesity, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years. This condition may cause reflux (backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus. Children with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). It often occurs with gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Symptoms may include: - Chest pain - Heartburn, worse when bending over or lying down - Swallowing difficulty A hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms. Pain and discomfort are due to the upward flow of stomach acid, air, or bile. Tests that may be used include: - Barium swallow x-ray - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatments may include: - Medicines to control stomach acid - Surgery to repair the hiatal hernia and prevent reflux Other measures to reduce symptoms include: - Avoiding large or heavy meals - Not lying down or bending over right after a meal - Reducing weight and not smoking - Raising the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) If medicines and lifestyle measures do not help control symptoms, you may need surgery. Treatment can relieve most symptoms of hiatal hernia. Complications may include: - Pulmonary (lung) aspiration - Slow bleeding and iron deficiency anemia (due to a large hernia) - Strangulation (closing off) of the hernia Call your health care provider if: - You have symptoms of a hiatal hernia. - You have a hiatal hernia and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment. - You develop new symptoms. Controlling risk factors such as obesity may help prevent hiatal hernia. Updated by: Michael M.

2.0	My father is suffering from IBS and is loosing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.	Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (Treatment): Though irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) doesn’t have a cure, your doctor can manage the symptoms with a combination of diet, medicines, probiotics, and therapies for mental health problems. You may have to try a few treatments to see what works best for you. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment plan.Changes in eating, diet, and nutrition, such as following a FODMAP diet, can help treat your symptoms.Your doctor may recommend medicine to relieve your symptoms.Fiber supplements to relieve constipation when increasing fiber in your diet doesn’t help. Laxatives to help with constipation. Laxatives work in different ways, and your doctor can recommend a laxative that’s right for you. Loperamide to reduce diarrhea by slowing the movement of stool through your colon. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal that reduces diarrhea in people with IBS, though it doesn’t reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce pain in your abdomen.  Antidepressants, such as low doses of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, to relieve IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. In theory, because of their effect on colon transit, tricyclic antidepressants should be better for people with IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be better for people with IBS with constipation, or IBS-C, although studies haven’t confirmed this theory. Tricyclic antidepressants work in people with IBS by reducing their sensitivity to pain in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as normalizing their GI motility and secretion. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) for people who have IBS-C to improve abdominal pain or discomfort and constipation symptoms.  Linaclotide (Linzess) for people who have IBS-C to relieve abdominal pain and increase how often you have bowel movements. The antibiotic rifaximin to reduce bloating by treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, experts are still debating and researching the use of antibiotics to treat IBS. Coated peppermint oil capsules to reduce IBS symptoms.Follow your doctor’s instructions when you use medicine to treat IBS. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects and what to do if you have them.Some medicines can cause side effects. Ask your doctor and your pharmacist about side effects before taking any medicine. MedlinePlus maintains the latest information about side effects and drug warnings.Your doctor may also recommend probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms—tiny organisms that can be seen only with a microscope. These microorganisms, most often bacteria, are like the microorganisms that are normally present in your GI tract. Studies have found that taking large enough amounts of probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, can improve symptoms of IBS. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.You can find probiotics in dietary supplements, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt.Discuss your use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including probiotics and dietary supplements, with your doctor.Psychological therapies may improve your IBS symptoms.Managing StressLearning to reduce stress can help improve IBS. With less stress, you may find you have less cramping and pain. You may also find it easier to manage your symptoms.Some options for managing stress includetaking part in stress reduction and relaxation therapies such as meditation getting counseling and support taking part in regular exercise such as walking or yoga reducing stressful life situations as much as possible getting enough sleepTalk TherapyTalk therapy may reduce stress and improve your IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy that health care professionals use to treat IBS are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on your thoughts and actions. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on how your emotions affect your IBS symptoms. This type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques.Gut-Directed HypnotherapyIn gut-directed hypnotherapy, a therapist uses hypnosis to help you relax the muscles in the colon.Mindfulness TrainingMindfulness training can teach you to focus your attention on sensations occurring at the moment and to avoid catastrophizing, or worrying about the meaning of those sensations.
1.8	My father is suffering from IBS and is loosing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.	Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (How can my diet treat the symptoms of IBS?): Eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help your irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea if you have IBS.Eating foods that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables, may help.Fiber may improve constipation symptoms caused by IBS because it makes stool soft and easier to pass. Fiber is a part of foods such as whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services state in its Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (PDF, 2.963 MB) that adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day.3While fiber may help constipation, it may not reduce the abdominal discomfort or pain of IBS. In fact, some people with IBS may feel a bit more abdominal discomfort after adding more fiber to their diet. Add foods with fiber to your diet a little at a time to let your body get used to them. Too much fiber at once can cause gas, which can trigger symptoms in people with IBS. Adding fiber to your diet slowly, by 2 to 3 grams a day, may help prevent gas and bloating.
1.4	My father is suffering from IBS and is loosing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.	Irritable bowel syndrome - aftercare (Diet): Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone. - Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating. This will help you look for a pattern of foods that may make your symptoms worse. - Avoid foods that cause symptoms. These may include fatty or fried foods, dairy products, caffeine, sodas, alcohol, chocolate, and grains such as wheat, rye, and barley. - Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals a day, rather than 3 larger ones. Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly.

Irritable bowel syndrome - aftercare: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes. Your health care provider will talk about things you can do at home to manage your condition. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be a lifelong condition. You may be suffering from cramping and loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, or some combination of these symptoms. For some people, IBS symptoms may interfere with work, travel, and attending social events. But taking medicines and making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone. - Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating.

Taking different medicines or not taking medicines the way you have been advised can lead to more problems. Stress may cause your intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. Many things can cause stress, including: - Not being able to do activities because of your pain - Changes or problems at work or at home - A busy schedule - Spending too much time alone - Having other medical problems A first step toward reducing your stress is to figure out what makes you feel stressed. - Look at the things in your life that cause you the most worry. - Keep a diary of the experiences and thoughts that seem to be related to your anxiety and see if you can make changes to these situations. - Reach out to other people. - Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, neighbor, or clergy member) who will listen to you. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve anxiety and stress.

1.2	My father is suffering from IBS and is loosing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.	Irritable bowel syndrome: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes. IBS is not the same as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The reasons why IBS develops are not clear. It can occur after a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection (giardiasis) of the intestines. This is called postinfectious IBS. There may also be other triggers, including stress. The intestine is connected to the brain using hormone and nerve signals that go back and forth between the bowel and the brain. These signals affect bowel function and symptoms. The nerves can become more active during stress. This can cause the intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. IBS can occur at any age. Often, it begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It is twice as common in women as in men.  It is less likely to begin in older people above 50 years of age. About 10% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS. It is the most common intestinal problem that causes people to be referred to a bowel specialist (gastroenterologist). IBS symptoms vary from person to person, and range from mild to severe. Most people have mild symptoms. You are said to have IBS when symptoms are present for at least 3 days a month for a period of 3 months or more. The main symptoms include: - Abdominal pain - Gas - Fullness - Bloating - Change in bowel habits. Can have either diarrhea (IBS-D), or constipation (IBS-C). Pain and other symptoms will often be reduced or go away after a bowel movement. Symptoms may flare up when there is a change in the frequency of your bowel movements. People with IBS may go back and forth between having constipation and diarrhea or have or mostly have one or the other. - If you have IBS with diarrhea, you will have frequent, loose, watery stools. You may have an urgent need to have a bowel movement, which may be hard to control. - If you have IBS with constipation, you will have a hard time passing stool, as well as fewer bowel movements. You may need to strain with a bowel movement and have cramps. Often, only a small amount or no stool at all will pass. The symptoms may get worse for a few weeks or a month, and then decrease for a while. In other cases, symptoms are present most of the time. You may also lose your appetite if you have IBS. However, blood in stools and unintentional weight loss are not a part of IBS. There is no test to diagnose IBS. Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose IBS based on your symptoms. Eating a lactose-free diet for 2 weeks may help the provider identify lactase deficiency (or lactose intolerance). The following tests may be done to rule out other problems: - Blood tests to see if you have celiac disease or a low blood count (anemia) - Stool cultures to check for an infection Your provider may recommend a colonoscopy. During this test, a flexible tube is inserted through the anus to examine the colon. You may need this test if: - Symptoms began later in life (over age 50) - You have symptoms such as weight loss or bloody stools - You have abnormal blood tests (such as a low blood count) Other disorders that can cause similar symptoms include: - Celiac disease - Colon cancer (cancer rarely causes typical IBS symptoms, unless symptoms such as weight loss, blood in the stools, or abnormal blood tests are also present) - Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. In some cases of IBS, lifestyle changes can help. For example, regular exercise and improved sleep habits may reduce anxiety and help relieve bowel symptoms. Dietary changes can be helpful. However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another. The following changes may help: - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas) - Eating smaller meals - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse) Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines. No one medicine works for everyone. Some that your provider may suggest include: - Anticholinergic medicines (dicyclomine, propantheline, belladonna, and hyoscyamine) taken about a half-hour before eating to control intestinal muscle spasms - Bisacodyl to treat constipation - Loperamide to treat diarrhea - Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants to help relieve intestinal pain - Lubiprostone for constipation symptoms - Rifaximin, an antibiotic Psychological therapy or medicines for anxiety or depression may help with the problem. IBS may be a life-long condition. For some people, symptoms are disabling and interfere with work, travel, and social activities. Symptoms often get better with treatment. IBS does not cause permanent harm to the intestines. Also, it does not lead to a serious disease, such as cancer. Call your provider if you have symptoms of IBS or if you notice changes in your bowel habits that do not go away. Updated by: Michael M.

0.875	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you&aposre recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm - such as a stroke or a mastectomy. Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely. It&aposs unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder. Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly, and in three stages. Each stage can last a number of months. - Freezing stage. Any movement of your shoulder causes pain, and your shoulder&aposs range of motion starts to become limited. - Frozen stage. Pain may begin to diminish during this stage. However, your shoulder becomes stiffer, and using it becomes more difficult. - Thawing stage. The range of motion in your shoulder begins to improve. For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep. The bones, ligaments and tendons that make up your shoulder joint are encased in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren&apost sure why this happens to some people, although it&aposs more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. Certain factors may increase your risk of developing frozen shoulder. Age and sex People 40 and older, particularly women, are more likely to have frozen shoulder. Immobility or reduced mobility People who&aposve had prolonged immobility or reduced mobility of the shoulder are at higher risk of developing frozen shoulder. Immobility may be the result of many factors, including: - Rotator cuff injury - Broken arm - Stroke - Recovery from surgery Systemic diseases People who have certain diseases appear more likely to develop frozen shoulder. Diseases that might increase risk include: - Diabetes - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) - Cardiovascular disease - Tuberculosis - Parkinson&aposs disease During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move in certain ways to check for pain and evaluate your range of motion (active range of motion). Your doctor might then ask you to relax your muscles while he or she moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion. In some cases, your doctor might inject your shoulder with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) to determine your passive and active range of motion. Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But your doctor may suggest imaging tests - such as X-rays or an MRI - to rule out other problems. Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible. Medications Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs. Therapy A physical therapist can teach you range-of-motion exercises to help recover as much mobility in your shoulder as possible. Your commitment to doing these exercises is important to optimize recovery of your mobility. Surgical and other procedures Most frozen shoulders get better on their own within 12 to 18 months. For persistent symptoms, your doctor may suggest: - Steroid injections. Injecting corticosteroids into your shoulder joint may help decrease pain and improve shoulder mobility, especially in the early stages of the process. - Joint distension. Injecting sterile water into the joint capsule can help stretch the tissue and make it easier to move the joint. - Shoulder manipulation. In this procedure, you receive a general anesthetic, so you&aposll be unconscious and feel no pain. Then the doctor moves your shoulder joint in different directions, to help loosen the tightened tissue. - Surgery. Surgery for frozen shoulder is rare, but if nothing else has helped, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove scar tissue and adhesions from inside your shoulder joint. Doctors usually perform this surgery with lighted, tubular instruments inserted through small incisions around your joint (arthroscopically). Continue to use the involved shoulder and extremity as much as possible given your pain and range-of-motion limits. Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can help relieve pain. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting extremely fine needles in your skin at specific points on your body. Typically, the needles remain in place for 15 to 40 minutes. During that time they may be moved or manipulated. Because the needles are hair thin and flexible and are generally inserted superficially, most acupuncture treatments are relatively painless. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) A TENS unit delivers a tiny electrical current to key points on a nerve pathway. The current, delivered through electrodes taped to your skin, isn&apost painful or harmful. It&aposs not known exactly how TENS works, but it&aposs thought that it might stimulate the release of pain-inhibiting molecules (endorphins) or block pain fibers that carry pain impulses.

2.0	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder is a condition in which the shoulder is painful and loses motion because of inflammation. The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint. Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include: - Diabetes - Thyroid problems - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause - Shoulder injury - Shoulder surgery - Open heart surgery - Cervical disk disease of the neck - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are: - Decreased motion of the shoulder - Pain - Stiffness Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder. You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion. It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day. Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion. Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated. Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy. Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.  Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years. After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you do not keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back. Complications may include: - Stiffness and pain continue even with therapy - The arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery If you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for referral and treatment. Early treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period. People who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control. Updated by: C.

0.5	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder - aftercare: A frozen shoulder is shoulder pain that leads to stiffness of your shoulder. Often the pain and stiffness are present all the time. The capsule of the shoulder joint is made of strong tissue (ligaments) that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones cannot move freely in the joint. This condition is called frozen shoulder. Frozen shoulder may develop with no known cause. It can also occur in people who: - Have thyroid disease, diabetes, or are going through menopause - Have a shoulder injury - Have had a stroke that makes them unable to use their arm - Have a cast on their arm that holds their arm in one position Symptoms of frozen shoulder often follow this pattern: - At first, you have a lot of pain, or a freezing feeling that prevents you from moving your arm. - Then your shoulder becomes very stiff and hard to move, but the pain lessens. It becomes hard to reach over your head or behind you. - Finally, the pain goes away and you can use your arm again. This is the thawing phase and can take months to end. It can take a few months to go through these stages of frozen shoulder. The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following: - Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint. - Refer you to a physical therapist. - Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include drugs to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint. You may also receive a shot of anti-inflammatory drug directly into the joint. Most people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery. Using moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness. For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store. - Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. - DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. Get help setting up your home so that you can get to everything you need without reaching above your shoulders or behind your back. - Keep the clothes that you wear most often in drawers and shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level. - Store food in cupboards, drawers, and refrigerator shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level. Get help with house cleaning, taking out the garbage, gardening, and other household tasks. DO NOT lift heavy things or do activities that require a lot of shoulder and arm strength. You will learn some simple exercises and stretches for your shoulder. - At first, try to do these exercises once every hour, or at least 4 times a day. - It is more important to do the exercises often than to do them for a long time each time you do them. - Use moist heat before the exercises to help lessen pain and increase movement. - The exercises should focus on stretching of the shoulder and range of motion. - Avoid exercises to strengthen your shoulder until the range of motion has returned. Some of the exercises are: - Shoulder stretches - Pendulum - Wall crawl - Rope and pulley stretches - Movements to help with internal and external rotation, such as hand behind back Your provider or physical therapist will show you how to do these exercises. Call your doctor if: - The pain in your shoulder is getting worse - You re-injure your arm or shoulder - Your frozen shoulder is making you feel sad or depressed Updated by: C.

0.625	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder (Treatment): Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible. Medications Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs. Therapy A physical therapist can teach you range-of-motion exercises to help recover as much mobility in your shoulder as possible. Your commitment to doing these exercises is important to optimize recovery of your mobility. Surgical and other procedures Most frozen shoulders get better on their own within 12 to 18 months.

-0.75	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder (Symptoms): Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly, and in three stages. Each stage can last a number of months. - Freezing stage. Any movement of your shoulder causes pain, and your shoulder&aposs range of motion starts to become limited. - Frozen stage. Pain may begin to diminish during this stage. However, your shoulder becomes stiffer, and using it becomes more difficult. - Thawing stage. The range of motion in your shoulder begins to improve. For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep.
-0.875	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder (Diagnosis): During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move in certain ways to check for pain and evaluate your range of motion (active range of motion). Your doctor might then ask you to relax your muscles while he or she moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion. In some cases, your doctor might inject your shoulder with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) to determine your passive and active range of motion. Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But your doctor may suggest imaging tests - such as X-rays or an MRI - to rule out other problems.
0.75	We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?	Frozen shoulder (Causes): The bones, ligaments and tendons that make up your shoulder joint are encased in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren&apost sure why this happens to some people, although it&aposs more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture.

I would appreciate any info you can share about Gastroparesis, Feeding tubes, and even TPN. Thanks	Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles (motility) in your stomach. Ordinarily, strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract. But if you have gastroparesis, your stomach&aposs motility is slowed down or doesn&apost work at all, preventing your stomach from emptying properly. Certain medications, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and high blood pressure and allergy medications, can lead to slow gastric emptying and cause similar symptoms. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medications may make their condition worse. Gastroparesis can interfere with normal digestion, cause nausea and vomiting, and cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. The cause of gastroparesis is usually unknown. Sometimes it&aposs a complication of diabetes, and some people develop gastroparesis after surgery. Although there&aposs no cure for gastroparesis, changes to your diet, along with medication, can offer some relief. Gastroparesis care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis include: - Vomiting - Nausea - A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites - Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier - Acid reflux - Abdominal bloating - Abdominal pain - Changes in blood sugar levels - Lack of appetite - Weight loss and malnutrition Many people with gastroparesis don&apost have any noticeable signs and symptoms. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. It&aposs not always clear what leads to gastroparesis. But in many cases, gastroparesis is believed to be caused by damage to a nerve that controls the stomach muscles (vagus nerve). The vagus nerve helps manage the complex processes in your digestive tract, including signaling the muscles in your stomach to contract and push food into the small intestine. A damaged vagus nerve can&apost send signals normally to your stomach muscles. This may cause food to remain in your stomach longer, rather than move normally into your small intestine to be digested. The vagus nerve can be damaged by diseases, such as diabetes, or by surgery to the stomach or small intestine. Factors that can increase your risk of gastroparesis: - Diabetes - Abdominal or esophageal surgery - Infection, usually a virus - Certain medications that slow the rate of stomach emptying, such as narcotic pain medications - Scleroderma (a connective tissue disease) - Nervous system diseases, such as Parkinson&aposs disease or multiple sclerosis - Hypothyroidism (low thyroid) Women are more likely to develop gastroparesis than are men. Doctors use several tests to help diagnose gastroparesis and rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests may include: - Gastric emptying study. This is the most important test used in making a diagnosis of gastroparesis. It involves eating a light meal, such as eggs and toast, that contains a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner that detects the movement of the radioactive material is placed over your abdomen to monitor the rate at which food leaves your stomach. You&aposll need to stop taking any medications that could slow gastric emptying. Ask your doctor if any of your medications might slow your digestion. - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure is used to visually examine your upper digestive system - your esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine (duodenum) - with a tiny camera on the end of a long, flexible tube.This test can also diagnose other conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease or pyloric stenosis, which can have symptoms similar to those of gastroparesis. - Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures within your body. Ultrasound can help diagnose whether problems with your gallbladder or your kidneys could be causing your symptoms. - Upper gastrointestinal series. This is a series of X-rays in which you drink a white, chalky liquid (barium) that coats the digestive system to help abnormalities show up. Treating gastroparesis begins with identifying and treating the underlying condition. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor can work with you to help you control it. Changes to your diet Maintaining adequate nutrition is the most important goal in the treatment of gastroparesis. Many people can manage gastroparesis with diet changes and dietary changes are the first step in managing this condition. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who can work with you to find foods that are easier for you to digest so that you&aposre more likely to get enough calories and nutrients from the food you eat. A dietitian might suggest that you try to: - Eat smaller meals more frequently - Chew food thoroughly - Eat well-cooked fruits and vegetables rather than raw fruits and vegetables - Avoid fibrous fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and broccoli, which may cause bezoars - Choose mostly low-fat foods, but if you can tolerate them, add small servings of fatty foods to your diet - Try soups and pureed foods if liquids are easier for you to swallow - Drink about 34 to 51 ounces (1 to 1.5 liters) of water a day - Exercise gently after you eat, such as going for a walk - Avoid carbonated drinks, alcohol and smoking - Try to avoid lying down for 2 hours after a meal - Take a multivitamin daily Here&aposs a brief list of foods recommended for people with gastroparesis (your dietitian can give you a more comprehensive list): - White bread and rolls and "light" whole-wheat bread without nuts or seeds - Plain or egg bagels - English muffins - Flour or corn tortillas - Pancakes - Puffed wheat and rice cereals - Cream of wheat or rice - White crackers - Potatoes, white or sweet (no skin) - Baked french fries - Rice - Pasta - Lean beef, veal and pork (not fried) - Chicken or turkey (no skin and not fried) - Crab, lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops, oysters - Tuna (packed in water) - Cottage cheese - Eggs - Tofu - Strained meat baby food - Baby food vegetables and fruits - Tomato sauce, paste, puree, juice - Carrots (cooked) - Beets (cooked) - Mushrooms (cooked) - Vegetable juice - Vegetable broth - Fruit juices and drinks - Applesauce - Bananas - Peaches and pears (canned) - Milk, if tolerated - Yogurt (without fruit pieces) - Custard and pudding - Frozen yogurt Medications Medications to treat gastroparesis may include: - Medications to stimulate the stomach muscles. These medications include metoclopramide (Reglan) and erythromycin (Eryc, E.E.S.). Metoclopramide has a risk of serious side effects. Erythromycin may lose its effectiveness over time, and can cause side effects, such as diarrhea. A newer medication, domperidone, with fewer side effects, is also available with restricted access. - Medications to control nausea and vomiting. Drugs that help ease nausea and vomiting include prochlorperazine (Compro) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom). A class of medications that includes ondansetron (Zofran) is sometimes used to help nausea and vomiting. Surgical treatment Some people with gastroparesis may be unable to tolerate any food or liquids. In these situations, doctors may recommend a feeding tube (jejunostomy tube) be placed in the small intestine. Or doctors may recommend a gastric venting tube to help relieve pressure from gastric contents. Feeding tubes can be passed through your nose or mouth or directly into your small intestine through your skin. The tube is usually temporary and is only used when gastroparesis is severe or when blood sugar levels can&apost be controlled by any other method. Some people may require an IV (parenteral) feeding tube that goes directly into a vein in the chest. Treatments under investigation Researchers are continuing to investigate new medications to treat gastroparesis. One example is a new drug in development called relamorelin. The results of a phase 2 clinical trial found the drug could speed up gastric emptying and reduce vomiting. The drug is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but a larger clinical trial is currently underway. A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy - a slender tube that&aposs threaded down the esophagus. One procedure used endoscopy to place a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open. Several research trials investigated the use of botulinum toxin administered through endoscopy without much success. This treatment is not recommended. Doctors are also studying the use of a minimally invasive surgical technique when someone needs a feeding tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy tube). Gastric electrical stimulation and pacing Gastric electrical stimulation is a surgically implanted device that provides electrical stimulation to stimulate stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis. The FDA allows the device to be used under a compassionate use exemption for those who can&apost control their gastroparesis symptoms with diet changes or medications. However, larger studies are needed. Gastric pacing also involves a surgically implanted device that stimulates the stomach muscles, but this device tries to more closely mimic normal stomach contractions. Currently, the device is too large and causes discomfort. Gastric pacing devices are only available in clinical trials right now. If you&aposre a smoker, stop. Your gastroparesis symptoms are less likely to improve over time if you keep smoking. People with gastroparesis who are overweight are also less likely to get better over time. There is some evidence that certain alternative treatments can be helpful to people with gastroparesis, although more studies are needed. Some treatments that look promising include: - Acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. During electroacupuncture, a small electrical current is passed through the needles. Studies have shown these treatments to ease gastroparesis symptoms more than a sham treatment. - STW 5 (Iberogast). This herbal formula from Germany contains nine different herbal extracts. It hasn&apost been shown to speed up gastric emptying, but was slightly better at easing digestive symptoms than a placebo. - Rikkunshito. This Japanese herbal formula also contains nine herbs. It may help reduce abdominal pain and the feeling of post-meal fullness. - Cannabis. There aren&apost any published clinical trials on cannabis and gastroparesis. However, cannabis - commonly known as marijuana - is thought to ease nausea and other digestive complaints. Derivatives of cannabis have been used by people who have cancer in the past, but there are better FDA-approved medications available to control nausea now. Because cannabis is often smoked, there&aposs concern about possible addiction and harm, similar to what occurs with tobacco smoke. In addition, daily users of marijuana (cannabis) may develop a condition that mimics the symptoms of gastroparesis called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Quitting cannabis may help.

Thanks	Do you have information about Nasogastric feeding tube: Summary : A nasogastric tube (NG tube) is a special tube that carries food and medicine to the stomach through the nose. It can be used for all feedings or for giving a person extra calories. It is important to take good care of the feeding bag and tubing so that they work properly. It is also important to take good care of the skin around the nostrils so that it does not get irritated. If your child has an NG tube, try to keep your child from touching or pulling on the tube. Follow any specific instructions your nurse gives you. Use the information below as a reminder or what to do. Flushing the Tube : Flushing the tube will help release any formula stuck to the inside of the tube. Flush the tube after each feeding, or as often as your nurse recommends. - First, wash your hands well with soap and water. - After the feeding is finished, add warm water to the feeding syringe and let it flow by gravity. - If the water does not go through, try changing positions a bit or attach the plunger to the syringe, and gently push the plunger part-way. DO NOT press all the way down or press fast. - Remove the syringe. - Close the NG tube cap. Taking Care of the Skin : Follow these general guidelines: - Clean the skin around the tube with warm water and a clean washcloth after each feeding. Remove any crust or secretions in the nose. - When removing a bandage or dressing from the nose, loosen it first with a bit of mineral oil or other lubricant. Then gently remove the bandage or dressing. Afterward, wash the mineral oil off the nose. - If you notice redness or irritation, try putting the tube in the other nostril. When to Call the Doctor : Call your child&aposs health care provider if you notice: - There is redness, swelling and irritation in both nostrils - The tube keeps getting clogged and you are unable to unclog it with water - The tube falls out Alternate Names : Feeding - nasogastric tube; NG tube; Bolus feeding; Continuous pump feeding; Gavage tube

I would appreciate any info you can share about Gastroparesis, Feeding tubes, and even TPN. Thanks	Gastroparesis (Eating, Diet, and Nutrition): Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal—instead of lying down—may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or puréed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a puréed diet helps improve symptoms. Puréed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia—a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope—a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don’t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition—an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis.
2.0	I am a current Gastroparesis fighter with a GJ feeding tube. I am also one of the admins for a GP support group and an advocacy group. I have become a volunteer advocater. I would appreciate any info you can share about Gastroparesis, Feeding tubes, and even TPN. Thanks	Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food—sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation—a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation—a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber—such as raw fruits and vegetables—or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope—a small, flexible tube with a light—to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum—the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist—a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars—solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach—that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider’s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person’s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal—such as eggs or an egg substitute—that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person’s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.

In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition—the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal—instead of lying down—may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or puréed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a puréed diet helps improve symptoms. Puréed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia—a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox.

This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person’s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person’s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual’s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or puréed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis— irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis— irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.

Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.1 Gastric Electrical Stimulation This treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope—a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms. Jejunostomy If medications and dietary changes don’t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe. Parenteral Nutrition When gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition—an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. How is gastroparesis treated if a person has diabetes? An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person’s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control. The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person’s insulin regimen. To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need to take insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessary A health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual’s needs and the severity of gastroparesis. In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or puréed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis— irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food— sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or puréed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition. For people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the person’s insulin regimen. References [1] Bai Y, Xu MJ, Yang X, et al.

Thanks	Gastroparesis (Alternative medicine): There is some evidence that certain alternative treatments can be helpful to people with gastroparesis, although more studies are needed. Some treatments that look promising include: - Acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. During electroacupuncture, a small electrical current is passed through the needles. Studies have shown these treatments to ease gastroparesis symptoms more than a sham treatment. - STW 5 (Iberogast). This herbal formula from Germany contains nine different herbal extracts. It hasn&apost been shown to speed up gastric emptying, but was slightly better at easing digestive symptoms than a placebo. - Rikkunshito. This Japanese herbal formula also contains nine herbs. It may help reduce abdominal pain and the feeling of post-meal fullness. - Cannabis. There aren&apost any published clinical trials on cannabis and gastroparesis. However, cannabis - commonly known as marijuana - is thought to ease nausea and other digestive complaints. Derivatives of cannabis have been used by people who have cancer in the past, but there are better FDA-approved medications available to control nausea now. Because cannabis is often smoked, there&aposs concern about possible addiction and harm, similar to what occurs with tobacco smoke. In addition, daily users of marijuana (cannabis) may develop a condition that mimics the symptoms of gastroparesis called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Quitting cannabis may help.

It hurts in my chest, and I can hardly talk.	Gastritis (Treatment): Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause. Acute gastritis caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol may be relieved by stopping use of those substances. Medications used to treat gastritis include: - Antibiotic medications to kill H. pylori. For H. pylori in your digestive tract, your doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin (Biaxin) and amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, others) or metronidazole (Flagyl), to kill the bacterium. Be sure to take the full antibiotic prescription, usually for seven to 14 days. - Medications that block acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors reduce acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. These drugs include the prescription and over-the-counter medications omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) and pantoprazole (Protonix). Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures. Ask your doctor whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk. - Medications to reduce acid production. Acid blockers - also called histamine (H-2) blockers - reduce the amount of acid released into your digestive tract, which relieves gastritis pain and encourages healing. Available by prescription or over-the-counter, acid blockers include ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet HB) and nizatidine (Axid AR). - Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Your doctor may include an antacid in your drug regimen. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. Side effects can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients.

Gastritis (How is gastritis treated?): Health care providers treat gastritis with medications toreduce the amount of acid in the stomach treat the underlying causereduce the amount of acid in the stomachtreat the underlying causeReduce the Amount of Acid in the StomachThe stomach lining of a person with gastritis may have less protection from acidic digestive juice. Reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. Medications that reduce acid includeantacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan. Many brands use different combinations of three basic salts—magnesium, aluminum, and calcium—along with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. Magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can cause constipation.

Curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. For example, if prolonged NSAID use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the NSAIDs, reduce the dose, or change pain medications. Health care providers may prescribe medications to prevent or treat stress gastritis in a patient who is critically ill or injured. Medications to protect the stomach lining include sucralfate (Carafate), H2 blockers, and PPIs. Treating the underlying illness or injury most often cures stress gastritis. Health care providers may treat people with pernicious anemia due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis with vitamin B12 injections.Treating H. pylori infection with antibiotics is important, even if a person does not have symptoms from the infection.

Autoimmune atrophic gastritis (Treatment): The treatment of autoimmune atrophic gastritis is generally focused on preventing or treating  vitamin B 12 and iron deficiencies. If pernicious anemia is already present at the time of diagnosis, vitamin B 12 shots (injections) may be recommended. Since dietary and oral iron supplements do not usually improve iron levels, alternative iron therapy approaches may include receiving periodic intravenous (IV) iron (iron infusion) to increase iron stores or a daily dose of oral ferrous glycine sulfate to meet daily iron requirements. People with autoimmune atrophic gastritis should have their levels of B 12 and iron monitored for the rest of their life. [1] [2] [3] In some cases, periodic endoscopy may also be recommended due to the increased risk of certain types of cancer . [1] [2] [3]

It hurts in my chest, and I can hardly talk.	Gastritis: Gastritis is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common: inflammation of the lining of the stomach. The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers. Regular use of certain pain relievers and drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis. Gastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis), or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis). In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer. For most people, however, gastritis isn&apost serious and improves quickly with treatment. The signs and symptoms of gastritis include: - Gnawing or burning ache or pain (indigestion) in your upper abdomen that may become either worse or better with eating - Nausea - Vomiting - A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating Gastritis doesn&apost always cause signs and symptoms. When to see a doctor Nearly everyone has had a bout of indigestion and stomach irritation. Most cases of indigestion are short-lived and don&apost require medical care. See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of gastritis for a week or longer. Tell your doctor if your stomach discomfort occurs after taking prescription or over-the-counter drugs, especially aspirin or other pain relievers. If you are vomiting blood, have blood in your stools or have stools that appear black, see your doctor right away to determine the cause. Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining. Weaknesses or injury to the mucus-lined barrier that protects your stomach wall allows your digestive juices to damage and inflame your stomach lining. A number of diseases and conditions can increase your risk of gastritis, including Crohn&aposs disease and sarcoidosis, a condition in which collections of inflammatory cells grow in the body. Factors that increase your risk of gastritis include: - Bacterial infection. Although infection with Helicobacter pylori is among the most common worldwide human infections, only some people with the infection develop gastritis or other upper gastrointestinal disorders. Doctors believe vulnerability to the bacterium could be inherited or could be caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking and diet. - Regular use of pain relievers. Common pain relievers - such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox) - can cause both acute gastritis and chronic gastritis. Using these pain relievers regularly or taking too much of these drugs may reduce a key substance that helps preserve the protective lining of your stomach. - Older age. Older adults have an increased risk of gastritis because the stomach lining tends to thin with age and because older adults are more likely to have H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders than younger people are. - Excessive alcohol use. Alcohol can irritate and erode your stomach lining, which makes your stomach more vulnerable to digestive juices. Excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute gastritis. - Stress. Severe stress due to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis. - Your own body attacking cells in your stomach. Called autoimmune gastritis, this type of gastritis occurs when your body attacks the cells that make up your stomach lining. This reaction can wear away at your stomach&aposs protective barrier. Autoimmune gastritis is more common in people with other autoimmune disorders, including Hashimoto&aposs disease and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune gastritis can also be associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency. - Other diseases and conditions. Gastritis may be associated with other medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, Crohn&aposs disease and parasitic infections. Left untreated, gastritis may lead to stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding. Rarely, some forms of chronic gastritis may increase your risk of stomach cancer, especially if you have extensive thinning of the stomach lining and changes in the lining&aposs cells. Tell your doctor if your signs and symptoms aren&apost improving despite treatment for gastritis. Although your doctor is likely to suspect gastritis after talking to you about your medical history and performing an exam, you may also have one or more of the following tests to pinpoint the exact cause. - Tests for H. pylori. Your doctor may recommend tests to determine whether you have the bacterium H. pylori. Which type of test you undergo depends on your situation. H. pylori may be detected in a blood test, in a stool test or by a breath test. For the breath test, you drink a small glass of clear, tasteless liquid that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori bacteria break down the test liquid in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you&aposre infected with H. pylori, your breath sample will contain the radioactive carbon. - Using a scope to examine your upper digestive system (endoscopy). During endoscopy, your doctor passes a flexible tube equipped with a lens (endoscope) down your throat and into your esophagus, stomach and small intestine. Using the endoscope, your doctor looks for signs of inflammation. If a suspicious area is found, your doctor may remove small tissue samples (biopsy) for laboratory examination. A biopsy can also identify the presence of H. pylori in your stomach lining. - X-ray of your upper digestive system. Sometimes called a barium swallow or upper gastrointestinal series, this series of X-rays creates images of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine to look for abnormalities. To make the ulcer more visible, you may swallow a white, metallic liquid (containing barium) that coats your digestive tract. Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause. Acute gastritis caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol may be relieved by stopping use of those substances. Medications used to treat gastritis include: - Antibiotic medications to kill H. pylori. For H. pylori in your digestive tract, your doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin (Biaxin) and amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, others) or metronidazole (Flagyl), to kill the bacterium. Be sure to take the full antibiotic prescription, usually for seven to 14 days. - Medications that block acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors reduce acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. These drugs include the prescription and over-the-counter medications omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) and pantoprazole (Protonix). Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures. Ask your doctor whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk. - Medications to reduce acid production. Acid blockers - also called histamine (H-2) blockers - reduce the amount of acid released into your digestive tract, which relieves gastritis pain and encourages healing.

Your doctor may include an antacid in your drug regimen. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. Side effects can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients. You may find some relief from signs and symptoms if you: - Eat smaller, more-frequent meals. If you experience frequent indigestion, eat smaller meals more often to help ease the effects of stomach acid. - Avoid irritating foods. Avoid foods that irritate your stomach, especially those that are spicy, acidic, fried or fatty. - Avoid alcohol. Alcohol can irritate the mucous lining of your stomach. - Consider switching pain relievers. If you use pain relievers that increase your risk of gastritis, ask your doctor whether acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may be an option for you. This medication is less likely to aggravate your stomach problem.

The stomach lining contains glands that produce stomach acid and an enzyme called pepsin. The stomach acid breaks down food and pepsin digests protein. A thick layer of mucus coats the stomach lining and helps prevent the acidic digestive juice from dissolving the stomach tissue. When the stomach lining is inflamed, it produces less acid and fewer enzymes. However, the stomach lining also produces less mucus and other substances that normally protect the stomach lining from acidic digestive juice.Gastritis may be acute or chronic:Acute gastritis starts suddenly and lasts for a short time. Chronic gastritis is long lasting. If chronic gastritis is not treated, it may last for years or even a lifetime.Acute gastritis starts suddenly and lasts for a short time.Chronic gastritis is long lasting. If chronic gastritis is not treated, it may last for years or even a lifetime.Gastritis can be erosive or nonerosive:Erosive gastritis can cause the stomach lining to wear away, causing erosions—shallow breaks in the stomach lining—or ulcers—deep sores in the stomach lining. Nonerosive gastritis causes inflammation in the stomach lining; however, erosions or ulcers do not accompany nonerosive gastritis.Erosive gastritis can cause the stomach lining to wear away, causing erosions—shallow breaks in the stomach lining—or ulcers—deep sores in the stomach lining.Nonerosive gastritis causes inflammation in the stomach lining; however, erosions or ulcers do not accompany nonerosive gastritis.A health care provider may refer a person with gastritis to a gastroenterologist—a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.A health care provider may refer a person with gastritis to a gastroenterologist—a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.

A health care provider performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. The small camera built into the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the GI lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patient&aposs throat before inserting the endoscope. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test may show signs of inflammation or erosions in the stomach lining.The health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope by a pathologist—a doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseases. A health care provider may use the biopsy to diagnose gastritis, find the cause of gastritis, and find out if chronic gastritis has progressed to atrophic gastritis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Endoscopy.Upper GI EndoscopyOther TestsA health care provider may have a patient complete other tests to identify the cause of gastritis or any complications. These tests may include the following:Upper GI series. Upper GI series is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper GI tract. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images. This test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should check with their health care provider about what to do to prepare for an upper GI series. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and health care provider can see these organs&apos shapes more clearly on x-rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract may cause white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series. Blood tests. A health care provider may use blood tests to check for anemia or H. pylori. A health care provider draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool test. A health care provider may use a stool test to check for blood in the stool, another sign of bleeding in the stomach, and for H. pylori infection. A stool test is an analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Urea breath test. A health care provider may use a urea breath test to check for H. pylori infection. The patient swallows a capsule, liquid, or pudding that contains urea—a waste product the body produces as it breaks down protein. The urea is “labeled” with a special carbon atom. If H. pylori are present, the bacteria will convert the urea into carbon dioxide. After a few minutes, the patient breathes into a container, exhaling carbon dioxide. A nurse or technician will perform this test at a health care provider&aposs office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab. If the test detects the labeled carbon atoms in the exhaled breath, the health care provider will confirm an H. pylori infection in the GI tract.Upper GI series.

Reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. Medications that reduce acid includeantacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan. Many brands use different combinations of three basic salts—magnesium, aluminum, and calcium—along with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. Magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can cause constipation.

Curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. For example, if prolonged NSAID use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the NSAIDs, reduce the dose, or change pain medications. Health care providers may prescribe medications to prevent or treat stress gastritis in a patient who is critically ill or injured. Medications to protect the stomach lining include sucralfate (Carafate), H2 blockers, and PPIs. Treating the underlying illness or injury most often cures stress gastritis.

Gastritis is a condition in which the stomachlining—known as the mucosa—is inflamed, or swollen. The stomach lining contains glands that produce stomach acid and an enzyme called pepsin. The stomach acid breaks down food and pepsin digests protein. A thick layer of mucus coats the stomach lining and helps prevent the acidic digestive juice from dissolving the stomach tissue. When the stomach lining is inflamed, it produces less acid and fewer enzymes. However, the stomach lining also produces less mucus and other substances that normally protect the stomach lining from acidic digestive juice. Gastritis may be acute or chronic: Acute gastritis starts suddenly and lasts for a short time. Chronic gastritis is long lasting. If chronic gastritis is not treated, it may last for years or even a lifetime. Gastritis can be erosive or nonerosive: Erosive gastritis can cause the stomach lining to wear away, causing erosions—shallow breaks in the stomach lining—or ulcers—deep sores in the stomach lining. Nonerosive gastritis causes inflammation in the stomach lining; however, erosions or ulcers do not accompany nonerosive gastritis. A health care provider may refer a person with gastritis to a gastroenterologist—a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. What causes gastritis? Common causes of gastritis include Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection damage to the stomach lining, which leads to reactive gastritis an autoimmune response H. pylori infection.

Other Tests A health care provider may have a patient complete other tests to identify the cause of gastritis or any complications. These tests may include the following: Upper GI series. Upper GI series is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper GI tract. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images. This test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should check with their health care provider about what to do to prepare for an upper GI series. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and health care provider can see these organs&apos shapes more clearly on x-rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract may cause white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series. Blood tests. A health care provider may use blood tests to check for anemia or H. pylori. A health care provider draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool test. A health care provider may use a stool test to check for blood in the stool, another sign of bleeding in the stomach, and for H. pylori infection. A stool test is an analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Urea breath test. A health care provider may use a urea breath test to check for H. pylori infection. The patient swallows a capsule, liquid, or pudding that contains urea—a waste product the body produces as it breaks down protein. The urea is “labeled” with a special carbon atom. If H. pylori are present, the bacteria will convert the urea into carbon dioxide. After a few minutes, the patient breathes into a container, exhaling carbon dioxide. A nurse or technician will perform this test at a health care provider&aposs office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab. If the test detects the labeled carbon atoms in the exhaled breath, the health care provider will confirm an H. pylori infection in the GI tract. How is gastritis treated? Health care providers treat gastritis with medications to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach treat the underlying cause Reduce the Amount of Acid in the Stomach The stomach lining of a person with gastritis may have less protection from acidic digestive juice. Reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. Medications that reduce acid include antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan. Many brands use different combinations of three basic salts—magnesium, aluminum, and calcium—along with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. Magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can cause constipation. H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC), nizatidine (Axid AR), and ranitidine (Zantac 75). H2 blockers decrease acid production. They are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). PPIs decrease acid production more effectively than H2 blockers. All of these medications are available by prescription. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are also available in over-the-counter strength. Treat the Underlying Cause Depending on the cause of gastritis, a health care provider may recommend additional treatments. Treating H. pylori infection with antibiotics is important, even if a person does not have symptoms from the infection. Curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. For example, if prolonged NSAID use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the NSAIDs, reduce the dose, or change pain medications. Health care providers may prescribe medications to prevent or treat stress gastritis in a patient who is critically ill or injured. Medications to protect the stomach lining include sucralfate (Carafate), H2 blockers, and PPIs. Treating the underlying illness or injury most often cures stress gastritis. Health care providers may treat people with pernicious anemia due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis with vitamin B12 injections. How can gastritis be prevented? People may be able to reduce their chances of getting gastritis by preventing H. pylori infection. No one knows for sure how H. pylori infection spreads, so prevention is difficult. To help prevent infection, health care providers advise people to wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and before eating eat food that has been washed well and cooked properly drink water from a clean, safe source Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a major role in causing or preventing gastritis. Points to Remember Gastritis is a condition in which the stomach lining—known as the mucosa—is inflamed, or swollen. Common causes of gastritis include Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, damage to the stomach lining, and an autoimmune response. Some people who have gastritis have pain or discomfort in the upper part of the abdomen. However, many people with gastritis do not have any signs and symptoms. Erosive gastritis may cause ulcers or erosions in the stomach lining that can bleed. A person with any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the stomach should call or see a health care provider right away. A health care provider diagnoses gastritis based on a medical history, a physical exam, upper GI endoscopy, and other tests. Health care providers treat gastritis with medications to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach and treat the underlying cause. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions. What are clinical trials, and are they right for you? Clinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses. Find out if clinical trials are right for you.

0.4	Can you mail me patient information about Glaucoma, I was recently diagnosed and want to learn all I can about the disease.	Facts About Glaucoma (How is glaucoma detected?): Glaucoma is detected through a comprehensive dilated eye exam that includes the following: Visual acuity test. This eye chart test measures how well you see at various distances. Visual field test. This test measures your peripheral (side vision). It helps your eye care professional tell if you have lost peripheral vision, a sign of glaucoma. Dilated eye exam. In this exam, drops are placed in your eyes to widen, or dilate, the pupils. Your eye care professional uses a special magnifying lens to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of damage and other eye problems. After the exam, your close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. Tonometry is the measurement of pressure inside the eye by using an instrument called a tonometer. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test. A tonometer measures pressure inside the eye to detect glaucoma. Pachymetry is the measurement of the thickness of your cornea. Your eye care professional applies a numbing drop to your eye and uses an ultrasonic wave instrument to measure the thickness of your cornea.

Do you have information about Patient Rights: Summary : As a patient, you have certain rights. Some are guaranteed by federal law, such as the right to get a copy of your medical records, and the right to keep them private. Many states have additional laws protecting patients, and healthcare facilities often have a patient bill of rights. An important patient right is informed consent. This means that if you need a treatment, your health care provider must give you the information you need to make a decision. Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you if you have problems. Many states have an ombudsman office for problems with long term care. Your state&aposs department of health may also be able to help.
0.3	Can you mail me patient information about Glaucoma, I was recently diagnosed and want to learn all I can about the disease.	Glaucoma (Exams and Tests): The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve. Eye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: - Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy). - Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging). - Checking your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. - Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response). - 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). - Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity). - Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement).
2.0	Can you mail me patient information about Glaucoma, I was recently diagnosed and want to learn all I can about the disease.	Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure. Watch this video about: Glaucoma Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma: - Open-angle glaucoma - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma - Congenital glaucoma - Secondary glaucoma The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye. - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. - Either type can damage the optic nerve. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it. - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision. - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack. - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye. Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: - Drugs such as corticosteroids - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye) - Diseases such as diabetes - Eye injury Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies. - It often runs in families. - It is present at birth. - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - Most people have no symptoms. - Once vision loss occurs, the damage is already severe. - Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). - Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness. ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: - Sudden, severe pain in one eye - Decreased or cloudy vision, often called "steamy" vision - Nausea and vomiting - Rainbow-like halos around lights - Red eye - Eye feels swollen CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. - Cloudiness of the front of the eye - Enlargement of one eye or both eyes - Red eye - Sensitivity to light - Tearing SECONDARY GLAUCOMA - Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma. - Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve.

The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops. - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past. - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment: - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack. - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack. CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain. SECONDARY GLAUCOMA If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider&aposs directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision. Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early. How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss. - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

Glaucoma (Symptoms): The signs and symptoms of glaucoma vary depending on the type and stage of your condition. For example: Open-angle glaucoma - Patchy blind spots in your side (peripheral) or central vision, frequently in both eyes - Tunnel vision in the advanced stages Acute angle-closure glaucoma - Severe headache - Eye pain - Nausea and vomiting - Blurred vision - Halos around lights - Eye redness If left untreated, glaucoma will eventually cause blindness. Even with treatment, about 15 percent of people with glaucoma become blind in at least one eye within 20 years. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical care Promptly go to an emergency room or an eye doctor&aposs (ophthalmologist&aposs) office if you experience some of the symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma, such as severe headache, eye pain and blurred vision. Schedule eye exams Open-angle glaucoma gives few warning signs until permanent damage has already occurred. Regular eye exams are the key to detecting glaucoma early enough to successfully slow or prevent vision loss. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends glaucoma screening: - Every four years beginning at age 40 if you don&apost have any glaucoma risk factors - Every two years if you&aposre at high risk or over 65
2.0	Hair loss Information Required Can you provide something to help grow my hair back? I need my hair back as im the spitting double of Dr evil with no hair.	Hair loss (Treatment): Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results. The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss. Medication If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months. Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It&aposs taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don&apost respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You&aposll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor.

Do you have information about Spitting up - self-care: Summary : Spitting up is common with babies. Babies may spit up when they burp or with their drool. Spitting up should not cause your baby any distress. Usually babies stop spitting up when they are about 7 to 12 months old. Why Babies Spit up : Your baby is spitting up because: - The muscle at the top of your baby&aposs stomach may not be fully developed. So baby&aposs stomach cannot hold in milk. - The valve at the bottom of the stomach may be too tight. So the stomach gets too full and milk comes out. - Your baby may drink too much milk too fast, and take in a lot of air in the process. These air bubbles fill up the stomach and milk comes out. - Overfeeding causes your baby to get too full. So milk comes up. Spitting up is usually not due to a formula intolerance or an allergy to something in the nursing mother&aposs diet. Spitting up is Usually Normal : If your baby is healthy, happy, and growing well, you don&apost need to worry. Babies that are growing well usually gain at least 6 ounces a week and have wet diapers at least every 6 hours. How to Reduce Spitting up : - Burp your baby several times during and after feeding. To do so sit the baby upright with your hand supporting the head. Let the baby lean forward slightly, bending at the waist. Gently pat your baby&aposs back. (Burping your baby over your shoulder puts pressure on the stomach. This might cause more spitting up.) - If you are breastfeeding, try nursing with just one breast per feeding. - If you are bottle feeding, feed smaller amounts of formula more frequently. Avoid large amounts at one time. Be sure that the hole in the nipple is not too large. - Hold your baby upright for 15 to 30 minutes after feedings. - Avoid a lot of movement during and immediately after feeding. - Slightly elevate the head of babies&apos cribs so babies can sleep with their heads slightly up. - Talk to your doctor about trying a different formula or removing certain foods from the mother&aposs diet (usually cow&aposs milk). When to Call the Doctor : If your baby&aposs spit up is forceful, call your baby&aposs doctor. You want to make sure your baby does not have pyloric stenosis, a problem where the valve at the bottom of the stomach is too tight and needs to be fixed.

You do not need treatment if you are comfortable with your appearance. MEDICINES The only medicine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness is minoxidil: - It is applied to the scalp. - For women, the 2% solution or 5% foam is recommended. - Minoxidil may help hair grow in about 1 in 4 or 5 of women. In most women, it may slow or stop hair loss. - You must continue to use this medicine for a long time. Hair loss starts again when you stop using it. Also, the hair that it helps grow will fall out. If minoxidil does not work, your provider may recommend other medicines, such as spironolactone, cimetidine, birth control pills, ketoconazole, among others. Your provider can tell you more about these if needed. HAIR TRANSPLANT During hair transplant, tiny plugs of hair are removed from areas where hair is thicker, and placed (transplanted) in areas that are balding. Minor scarring may occur where hair is removed. There is a slight risk of skin infection. You will likely need many transplants, which can be expensive. However, the results are often excellent and permanent. OTHER SOLUTIONS Hair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairstyle can help hide hair loss and improve your appearance. This is often the least expensive and safest way to deal with female pattern baldness.

Coping with cancer - hair loss (Tips to Deal with Hair Loss): If your provider has told you treatment may cause hair loss, you might want to cut your hair short before your first treatment. This could make losing your hair less shocking and upsetting. If you decide to shave your head, use an electric razor and be careful not to cut your scalp. Some people get wigs and some cover their heads with scarves or hats. Some people do not wear anything on their heads. What you decide to do is up to you. Wig options: - If you think you will want to have a wig, go to the salon before your hair falls out so they can set you up with a wig that matches your hair color. Your provider may have names of salons that make wigs for people with cancer. - Try different wig styles to decide what you like best. - If you want, you can also try a different hair color. The stylist can work help you find a color that looks good with your skin tone. - Find out if the cost of the wig is covered by your insurance. Other suggestions: - Scarves, hats, and turbans are comfortable options. - Ask your provider if cold cap therapy is right for you. With cold cap therapy, the scalp is cooled. This causes the hair follicles go into a state of rest. As a result, hair loss may be limited. - Wear soft material next to your skin. - On sunny days, remember to protect your scalp with a hat, scarf, and sunblock. - In cold weather, do not forget a hat or head scarf to keep you warm.

Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

Trichotillomania (Treatment): Behavioral treatment seems to be the most powerful treatment for trichotillomania. Parental involvement is important and should include enough support so that affected children grow well intellectually, physically, and socially. Shaving or clipping hair close to the scalp may be helpful to stop the behavior. [4] Professional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended if initial approaches are unsuccessful. CBT typically involves self monitoring (keeping records of the behavior); habit-reversal training; and stimulus control (organizing the environment). CBT is typically effective in highly motivated and compliant patients. The success of therapy may depend on firm understanding of the illness and the cooperation of the family members to help the affected individual comply with treatment. Several courses of CBT may be needed. [4] No medication has been approved for the treatment of trichotillomania, and medications used have not been consistently effective. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been utilized but responses to treatment have not been consistent. Fortunately, several recent studies regarding drug therapy for trichotillomania show promise. While drug therapy alone is currently generally not effective, combination therapy and other treatments may be helpful.

2.0	Hello, I have a scoliosis problem plz help me I want its treatment I can send my x.ray also	Scoliosis (Treatment): Treatment depends on many things: - The cause of scoliosis - Where the curve is in your spine - How big the curve is - If your body is still growing Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment. But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months. If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow. Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis. You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible: - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs. - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together. - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still. Scoliosis treatment may also include: - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly.
1.88888888889	Hello, I have a scoliosis problem plz help me I want its treatment I can send my x.ray also	Scoliosis (Treatment): Most children with scoliosis have mild curves and probably won&apost need treatment with a brace or surgery. Children who have mild scoliosis may need checkups every four to six months to see if there have been changes in the curvature of their spines. While there are guidelines for mild, moderate and severe curves, the decision to begin treatment is always made on an individual basis. Factors to be considered include: - Sex. Girls have a much higher risk of progression than do boys. - Severity of curve. Larger curves are more likely to worsen with time. - Curve pattern. Double curves, also known as S-shaped curves, tend to worsen more often than do C-shaped curves. - Location of curve. Curves located in the center (thoracic) section of the spine worsen more often than do curves in the upper or lower sections of the spine. - Maturity. If a child&aposs bones have stopped growing, the risk of curve progression is low. That also means that braces have the most effect in children whose bones are still growing. Braces If your child&aposs bones are still growing and he or she has moderate scoliosis, your doctor may recommend a brace. Wearing a brace won&apost cure scoliosis or reverse the curve, but it usually prevents further progression of the curve. The most common type of brace is made of plastic and is contoured to conform to the body. This close-fitting brace is almost invisible under the clothes, as it fits under the arms and around the rib cage, lower back and hips. Most braces are worn day and night. A brace&aposs effectiveness increases with the number of hours a day it&aposs worn. Children who wear braces can usually participate in most activities and have few restrictions. If necessary, kids can take off the brace to participate in sports or other physical activities. Braces are discontinued after the bones stop growing. This typically occurs: - About two years after girls begin to menstruate - When boys need to shave daily - When there are no further changes in height Surgery Severe scoliosis typically progresses with time, so your doctor might suggest scoliosis surgery to reduce the severity of the spinal curve and to prevent it from getting worse. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is called spinal fusion. In spinal fusion, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together, so they can&apost move independently. Pieces of bone or a bone-like material are placed between the vertebrae. Metal rods, hooks, screws or wires typically hold that part of the spine straight and still while the old and new bone material fuses together. If the scoliosis is progressing rapidly at a young age, surgeons can install a rod that can adjust in length as the child grows. This growing rod is attached to the top and bottom sections of the spinal curvature, and is usually lengthened every six months. Complications of spinal surgery may include bleeding, infection, pain or nerve damage. Rarely, the bone fails to heal and another surgery may be needed.

Treatment recommendations are generally dependent upon the risk of curve progression. Curves progress most during the rapid growth period of the patient (adolescent or pre-adolescent growth spurt). The potential for growth is evaluated by taking into consideration the patient&aposs age, the status of whether females have had their first menstrual period, and radiographic parameters ( x-ray studies). [2] Detailed information about these treatment options can be accessed through the Scoliosis Research Society.

A feeding tube may be needed if the child breathes in (aspirates) food. A diet high in calories and fat combined with feeding tubes can help increase weight and height. Weight gain may improve alertness and social interaction. Medicines may be used to treat seizures. Supplements may be tried for constipation, alertness, or rigid muscles. Stem cell therapy, alone or in combination with gene therapy, is another hopeful treatment.

1.77777777778	Hello, I have a scoliosis problem plz help me I want its treatment I can send my x.ray also	Scoliosis: Scoliosis is an abnormal curving of the spine. Your spine is your backbone. It runs straight down your back. Everyone&aposs spine naturally curves a bit. But people with scoliosis have a spine that curves too much. The spine might look like the letter C or S. Most of the time, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. It is the most common type. It is grouped by age. - In children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis. - In children age 4 through 10, it is called juvenile scoliosis. - In children age 11 through 18, it is called adolescent scoliosis. Scoliosis most often affects girls. Some people are more likely to have curving of the spine. Curving generally gets worse during a growth spurt. Other types of scoliosis are: - Congenital scoliosis: This type of scoliosis is present at birth. It occurs when the baby’s ribs or spine bones do not form properly. - Neuromuscular scoliosis: This type is caused by a nervous system problem that affects the muscles. Problems can include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and polio. Most often, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include: - Backache or low-back pain - Tired feeling in the spine after sitting or standing for a long time - Uneven hips or shoulders (one shoulder may be higher than the other) - Spine curves more to one side The health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked to bend forward. This makes your spine easier to see. It may be hard to see changes in the early stages of scoliosis. The exam may show: - One shoulder is higher than the other - The pelvis is tilted X-rays of the spine are done. X-rays are important because the actual curving of the spine may be worse than what your doctor can see during an exam. Other tests may include: - Spinal curve measurement (scoliometer screening) - MRI of the spine Treatment depends on many things: - The cause of scoliosis - Where the curve is in your spine - How big the curve is - If your body is still growing Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment. But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months. If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it.

Scoliosis treatment may also include: - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly. Seek support and more information from organizations that specialize in scoliosis. How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. The more severe the curving, the more likely it will get worse after the child stops growing. People with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older. Outlook for those with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis varies. They may have another serious disorder, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, so their goals are much different. Often, the goal of surgery is simply to allow a child to be able to sit upright in a wheelchair. Congenital scoliosis is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries. Complications of scoliosis can include: - Breathing problems (in severe scoliosis) - Low back pain - Lower self-esteem - Persistent pain if there is wear and tear of the spine bones - Spinal infection after surgery - Spine or nerve damage from an uncorrected curve or spinal surgery Call your provider if you suspect your child may have scoliosis. Routine scoliosis screening is now done in middle schools. Such screening has helped detect early scoliosis in many children. Updated by: Neil K.

1.66666666667	Hello, I have a scoliosis problem plz help me I want its treatment I can send my x.ray also	Scoliosis: Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown. Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that continue to get more severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly. Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis. Signs and symptoms of scoliosis may include: - Uneven shoulders - One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other - Uneven waist - One hip higher than the other If a scoliosis curve gets worse, the spine will also rotate or twist, in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs on one side of the body to stick out farther than on the other side. When to see a doctor Go to your doctor if you notice signs or symptoms of scoliosis in your child. Mild curves, however, can develop without the parent or child knowing it because they appear gradually and usually don&apost cause pain. Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child&aposs scoliosis. Doctors don&apost know what causes the most common type of scoliosis - although it appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder tends to run in families. Less common types of scoliosis may be caused by: - Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy - Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine - Injuries to or infections of the spine Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include: - Age. Signs and symptoms typically begin during the growth spurt that occurs just prior to puberty. - Sex. Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment. - Family history. Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don&apost have a family history of the disease. The doctor will initially take a detailed medical history and may ask questions about recent growth. During the physical exam, your doctor may have your child stand and then bend forward from the waist, with arms hanging loosely, to see if one side of the rib cage is more prominent than the other. Your doctor may also perform a neurological exam to check for: - Muscle weakness - Numbness - Abnormal reflexes Imaging tests Plain X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis and reveal the severity of the spinal curvature. If a doctor suspects that an underlying condition - such as a tumor - is causing the scoliosis, he or she may recommend additional imaging tests, such as an MRI. Most children with scoliosis have mild curves and probably won&apost need treatment with a brace or surgery. Children who have mild scoliosis may need checkups every four to six months to see if there have been changes in the curvature of their spines.

1.8	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	Obesity (Treatment): The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. You may need to work with a team of health professionals - including a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist - to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The initial treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss - 3 to 5 percent of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kg) and are obese by BMI standards, you would need to lose only about 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kg) for your health to begin to improve. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require changes in your eating habits and increased physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. Other treatment tools include: - Dietary changes - Exercise and activity - Behavior change - Prescription weight-loss medications - Weight-loss surgery Dietary changes Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are vital to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, slow and steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight and the best way to keep it off permanently. Avoid drastic and unrealistic diet changes, such as crash diets, because they&aposre unlikely to help you keep excess weight off for the long term. Plan to participate in a comprehensive weight-loss program for at least six months and in the maintenance phase of a program for at least a year to boost your odds of weight-loss success. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: - Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. You and your health care providers can review your typical eating and drinking habits to see how many calories you normally consume and where you can cut back. You and your doctor can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight, but a typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. - Feeling full on less. The concept of energy density can help you satisfy your hunger with fewer calories. All foods have a certain number of calories within a given amount (volume). Some foods - such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods - are high in energy density. This means that a small volume of that food has a large number of calories. In contrast, other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, have lower energy density. These foods provide a larger portion size with a fewer number of calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you reduce hunger pangs, take in fewer calories and feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. - Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain carbohydrates. Also emphasize lean sources of protein - such as beans, lentils and soy - and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Stick with low-fat dairy products. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. - Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your doctor which diet plans have been found effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended, and limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. - Meal replacements. These plans suggest that you replace one or two meals with their products - such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars - and eat healthy snacks and a healthy, balanced third meal that&aposs low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. Keep in mind that these diets likely won&apost teach you how to change your overall lifestyle, though, so you may have to keep this up if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. The reality, however, is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don&apost appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you&aposre likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight - and keep it off - you have to adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activity Increased physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment. Most people who are able to maintain their weight loss for more than a year get regular exercise, even simply walking. To boost your activity level: - Exercise. People who are overweight or obese need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity to prevent further weight gain or to maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. To achieve more-significant weight loss, you may need to exercise 300 minutes or more a week. You probably will need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. - Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. Making simple changes throughout your day can add up to big benefits. Park farther from store entrances, rev up your household chores, garden, get up and move around periodically, and wear a pedometer to track how many steps you actually take over the course of a day. Behavior changes A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes and lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include examining your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Everyone is different and has different obstacles to managing weight, such as a lack of time to exercise or late-night eating. Tailor your behavior changes to address your individual concerns. Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, can include: - Counseling. Therapy or interventions with trained mental health or other professionals can help you address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You can also learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Therapy can take place on both an individual and group basis. More-intensive programs - those that include 12 to 26 sessions a year - may be more helpful in achieving your weight-loss goals. - Support groups. You can find camaraderie and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your doctor, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area, such as Weight Watchers. Prescription weight-loss medication Losing weight requires a healthy diet and regular exercise. But in certain situations, prescription weight-loss medication may help. Keep in mind, though, that weight-loss medication is meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. If you don&apost make these other changes in your life, medication is unlikely to work. Your doctor may recommend weight-loss medication if other methods of weight loss haven&apost worked for you and you meet one of the following criteria: - Your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or greater - Your BMI is greater than 27, and you also have medical complications of obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea Before selecting a medication for you, your doctor will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. Some weight-loss medications can&apost be used by women who are pregnant, or people who take certain medications or have chronic health conditions. Commonly prescribed weight-loss medications include orlistat (Xenical), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), buproprion and naltrexone (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda). You will need close medical monitoring while taking a prescription weight-loss medication. Also, keep in mind that a weight-loss medication may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medication, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Weight-loss surgery In some cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option. Weight-loss surgery limits the amount of food you&aposre able to comfortably eat or decreases the absorption of food and calories or both. While weight-loss surgery offers the best chance of losing the most weight, it can pose serious risks. Weight-loss surgery for obesity may be considered if you have tried other methods to lose weight that haven&apost worked and: - You have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) - Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, and you also have a serious weight-related health problem, such as diabetes or high blood pressure - You&aposre committed to making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work It doesn&apost guarantee that you&aposll lose all of your excess weight or that you&aposll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. It doesn&apost guarantee that you&aposll lose all of your excess weight or that you&aposll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Common weight-loss surgeries include: - Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of your stomach. - Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). In this procedure, your stomach is separated into two pouches with an inflatable band. Pulling the band tight, like a belt, the surgeon creates a tiny channel between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from expanding and is generally designed to stay in place permanently. - Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. This procedure begins with the surgeon removing a large part of the stomach. The surgeon leaves the valve that releases food to the small intestine and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Then the surgeon closes off the middle section of the intestine and attaches the last part directly to the duodenum. The separated section of the intestine is reattached to the end of the intestine to allow bile and digestive juices to flow into this part of the intestine. - Gastric sleeve. In this procedure, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It&aposs a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Other treatments Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology received FDA approval in 2014 for use by adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss program and who have a BMI of 35 to 45 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Preventing weight regain after obesity treatment Unfortunately, it&aposs common to regain weight no matter what obesity treatment methods you try. If you take weight-loss medications, you&aposll probably regain weight when you stop taking them. You might even regain weight after weight-loss surgery if you continue to overeat or overindulge in high-calorie foods. But that doesn&apost mean your weight-loss efforts are futile. One of the best ways to prevent regaining the weight you&aposve lost is to get regular physical activity. Aim for 60 minutes a day. Keep track of your physical activity if it helps you stay motivated and on course. As you lose weight and gain better health, talk to your doctor about what additional activities you might be able to do and, if appropriate, how to give your activity and exercise a boost. You may always have to remain vigilant about your weight. Combining a healthier diet and more activity in a practical and sustainable manner are the best ways to keep the weight you lost off for the long term. Take your weight loss and weight maintenance one day at a time and surround yourself with supportive resources to help ensure your success. Find a healthier way of living that you can stick with for the long term.
-0.8	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	What is Obesity?: Obesity means having too much body fat. It is not the same as being overweight, which means weighing too much. A person may be overweight from extra muscle or water, as well as from having too much fat. Both terms mean that a person&aposs weight is higher than what is thought to be healthy for his or her height.
2.0	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	Overweight and Obesity (Treatment): Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It’s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.  Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain’s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. Look for Living With will explain recommendations that your doctor may give, including lifelong healthy lifestyle changes and medical care to prevent your condition from recurring, getting worse, or causing complications.

-0.9	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	What is Obesity?: Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person&aposs weight is greater than what&aposs considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity occurs over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. Being obese increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you are obese, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

1.9	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	Obesity (Treatment): CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends. Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine. Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle. Work with your provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about: - Healthy food choices - Healthy snacks - Reading nutrition labels - New ways to prepare food - Portion sizes - Sweetened drinks Extreme diets (fewer than 1100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often DO NOT contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again. Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider. MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them. You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds (2 kg) by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes. SURGERY Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include: - Arthritis - Diabetes - Heart disease - High blood pressure - Sleep apnea - Some cancers - Stroke Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine. Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you. Weight-loss surgeries include: - Laparoscopic gastric banding - Gastric bypass surgery - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common) - Duodenal switch

By choosing an off-label medication to treat overweight and obesity, your doctor may prescribea drug approved for treating a different medical problem two or more drugs at the same time a drug for a longer period of time than approved by the FDAYou should feel comfortable asking your doctor if he or she is prescribing a medication that is not approved just for treating overweight and obesity. Before using a medication, learn all you need to know about it.
0.5	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	Prescription Medications to Treat Overweight and Obesity: Health care providers use the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of your weight in relation to your height, to define overweight and obesity. People who have a BMI between 25 and 30 are considered overweight. Obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater. You can calculate your BMI to learn if you are overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of health problems. Your health care provider can assess your individual risk due to your weight.Obesity is a chronic condition that affects more than one in three adults in the United States. Another one in three adults is overweight. If you are struggling with your weight, you may find that a healthy eating plan and regular physical activity help you lose weight and keep it off over the long term. If these lifestyle changes are not enough to help you lose weight or maintain your weight loss, your doctor may prescribe medications as part of your weight-control program. Prescription medications to treat overweight and obesity work in different ways. For example, some medications may help you feel less hungry or full sooner. Other medications may make it harder for your body to absorb fat from the foods you eat. Weight-loss medications are meant to help people who may have health problems related to overweight or obesity. Before prescribing a weight-loss medication, your doctor also will considerthe likely benefits of weight loss the medication’s possible side effects your current health issues and other medications your family&aposs medical history costHealth care professionals often use BMI to help decide who might benefit from weight-loss medications. Your doctor may prescribe a medication to treat your overweight or obesity if you are an adult witha BMI of 30 or more or a BMI of 27 or more and you have weight-related health problems, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes.Weight-loss medications aren’t for everyone with a high BMI. Some people who are overweight or obese may lose weight with a lifestyle program that helps them change their behaviors and improve their eating and physical activity habits. A lifestyle program may also address other factors that affect weight gain, such as eating triggers and not getting enough sleep. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved most weight-loss medications only for adults. The prescription medication orlistat (Xenical) is FDA-approved for children ages 12 and older. Medications don’t replace physical activity or healthy eating habits as a way to lose weight. Studies show that weight-loss medications work best when combined with a lifestyle program. Ask your doctor or other health care professional about lifestyle treatment programs for weight management that will work for you.Weight-loss medications don’t replace physical activity and healthy eating habits. When combined with changes to behavior, including eating and physical activity habits, prescription medications may help some people lose weight. On average, people who take prescription medications as part of a lifestyle program lose between 3 and 9 percent more of their starting body weight than people in a lifestyle program who do not take medication. Research shows that some people taking prescription weight-loss medications lose 10 percent or more of their starting weight.1 Results vary by medication and by person.Weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your starting body weight may help improve your health by lowering blood sugar, blood pressure, and triglycerides. Losing weight also can improve some other health problems related to overweight and obesity, such as joint pain or sleep apnea. Most weight loss takes place within the first 6 months of starting the medication. Experts are concerned that, in some cases, the side effects of prescription medications to treat overweight and obesity may outweigh the benefits. For this reason, you should never take a weight-loss medication only to improve the way you look. In the past, some weight-loss medications were linked to serious health problems. For example, the FDA recalled fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine (part of the “fen-phen” combination) in 1997 because of concerns related to heart valve problems.Possible side effects vary by medication and how it acts on your body. Most side effects are mild and most often improve if you continue to take the medication. Rarely, serious side effects can occur.Tips for Taking Weight-loss MedicationFollow your doctor&aposs instructions about weight-loss medications. Buy your medication from a pharmacy or web distributor approved by your doctor. Take weight-loss medication to support your healthy eating and physical activity program. Know the side effects and warnings for taking any medication. Ask your doctor if you should stop taking your medication if you are not losing weight after 12 weeks. Discuss other medications, including supplements and vitamins, you are taking with your doctor when considering weight-loss medications. Avoid taking weight-loss medications during pregnancy or if you are planning a pregnancy. Choosing a medication to treat overweight or obesity is a decision between you and your doctor. Important factors to consider includethe likely benefits of weight loss the medication’s possible side effects your current health issues and other medications your family’s medical history costTalk with your doctor about which weight-loss medication might be right for you. How long you will need to take weight-loss medication depends on whether the drug helps you lose and maintain weight and whether you have any side effects. If you have lost enough weight to improve your health and are not having serious side effects, your doctor may advise that you stay on the medication indefinitely. If you do not lose at least 5 percent of your starting weight after 12 weeks on the full dose of your medication, your doctor will probably advise you to stop taking it. He or she may change your treatment plan or consider using a different weight-loss medication. Your doctor also may have you try different lifestyle, physical activity, or eating programs; change your other medications that cause weight gain; or refer you to a bariatric surgeon to see if weight-loss surgery might be an option for you.Because obesity is a chronic condition, you may need to continue changes to your eating and physical activity habits and other behaviors for years—or even a lifetime—to improve your health and maintain a healthy weight. You will probably regain some weight after you stop taking weight-loss medication. Developing and maintaining healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity may help you regain less weight or keep it off. Federal physical activity guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week for adults—that’s about 30 minutes a day most days of the week. You may need to do more to reach or maintain your weight-loss goal. Some, but not all, insurance plans cover medications that treat overweight and obesity. Contact your insurance provider to find out if your plan covers these medications. The table below lists FDA-approved prescription medications for weight loss. The FDA has approved five of these drugs—orlistat (Xenical, Alli), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia), naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda)—for long-term use. You can keep taking these drugs as long as you are benefiting from treatment and not having unpleasant side-effects.Some weight-loss medications that curb appetite are approved by the FDA only for short-term use, or up to 12 weeks. Although some doctors prescribe them for longer periods of time, not many research studies have looked at how safe and effective they are for long-term use.Pregnant women should never take weight-loss medications. Women who are planning to get pregnant also should avoid these medications, as some of them may harm a fetus.Prescription Medications Approved for Overweight and Obesity TreatmentWeight-loss medication Approved for How it works Common side effects Warnings Orlistat (Xenical) Available in lower dose without prescription (Alli) Adults and children ages 12 and older Works in your gut to reduce the amount of fat your body absorbs from the food you eat diarrhea gas leakage of oily stools stomach pain Rare cases of severe liver injury have been reported.

0.4	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	Childhood obesity (Treatment): Treatment for childhood obesity is based on your child&aposs age and if he or she has other medical conditions. Treatment usually includes changes in your child&aposs eating habits and physical activity level. In certain circumstances, treatment might include medications or weight-loss surgery. Treatment for children who are overweight The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children older than 2 and adolescents whose weight falls in the overweight category be put on a weight-maintenance program to slow the progress of weight gain. This strategy allows the child to add inches in height but not pounds, causing BMI to drop over time into a healthier range. Treatment for children who are obese Children ages 6 to 11 who are obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits for gradual weight loss of no more than 1 pound (or about 0.5 kilogram) a month. Older children and adolescents who are obese or severely obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits to aim for weight loss of up to 2 pounds (or about 1 kilogram) a week. The methods for maintaining your child&aposs current weight or losing weight are the same: Your child needs to eat a healthy diet - both in terms of type and amount of food - and increase physical activity. Success depends largely on your commitment to helping your child make these changes. Healthy eating Parents are the ones who buy groceries, cook meals and decide where the food is eaten. Even small changes can make a big difference in your child&aposs health. - When food shopping, choose fruits and vegetables. Cut back on convenience foods - such as cookies, crackers and prepared meals - which are often high in sugar, fat and calories. Always have healthy snacks available. - Limit sweetened beverages. This includes those that contain fruit juice. These drinks provide little nutritional value in exchange for their high calories. They also can make your child feel too full to eat healthier foods. - Limit fast food. Many of the menu options are high in fat and calories. - Sit down together for family meals. Make it an event - a time to share news and tell stories. Discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen, which can lead to fast eating and lowered awareness of amount eaten. - Serve appropriate portion sizes. Children don&apost need as much food as adults do. Allow your child to eat until he or she is full, even if that means leaving food on the plate. And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often significantly oversized. Physical activity A critical part of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, especially for children, is physical activity. It burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day. Good habits established in childhood help adolescents maintain healthy weights despite the hormonal changes, rapid growth and social influences that often lead to overeating. And active children are more likely to become fit adults. To increase your child&aposs activity level: - Limit TV and recreational computer time. Time spent watching television or using computers, smartphones or tablets is known as screen time. Children younger than 18 months should avoid all screen time, except for video-chatting with family and friends. For older preschooolers, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programming. - Emphasize activity, not exercise. Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day. Your child&aposs activity doesn&apost have to be a structured exercise program - the object is to get him or her moving. Free-play activities - such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope - can be great for burning calories and improving fitness. - Find activities your child likes. For instance, if your child is artistically inclined, go on a nature hike to collect leaves and rocks that your child can use to make a collage. If your child likes to climb, head for the nearest neighborhood jungle gym or climbing wall. If your child likes to read, then walk or bike to the neighborhood library for a book. Medications Medication might be prescribed for some adolescents as part of an overall weight-loss plan. The risks of taking a prescription medication over the long term are unknown, and the medication&aposs effect on weight loss and weight maintenance for adolescents is still in question. Weight-loss surgery Weight-loss surgery may be an option for severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on future growth and development are largely unknown. Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is uncommon. But your doctor might recommend this surgery if your child&aposs weight poses a greater health threat than do the potential risks of surgery. It&aposs important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist and dietitian. Weight-loss surgery isn&apost a miracle cure. It doesn&apost guarantee that an adolescent will lose all of his or her excess weight or be able to keep it off long term. And surgery doesn&apost replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity.
0.7	help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help	Obesity (Alternative medicine): Numerous dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The effectiveness, particularly the long-term effectiveness, and safety of these products are often questionable. Herbal remedies, vitamins and minerals, all considered dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration, don&apost have the same rigorous testing and labeling process as over-the-counter and prescription medications do. Yet some of these substances, including products labeled as "natural," have drug-like effects that can be dangerous. Even some vitamins and minerals can cause problems when taken in excessive amounts. Ingredients may not be standard, and they can cause unpredictable and harmful side effects.

These medicines stop the virus from multiplying. TREATING PREGNANT WOMEN Treating pregnant women with HIV prevents children from becoming infected. - If a woman tests positive during pregnancy, she will receives ART while pregnant. Most often she will receive a three-drug regimen. - The risk of these ART drugs for the baby in the womb is low. The mother may have another ultrasound at the second trimester. - HIV may be found in a woman when she goes into labor, especially if she has not previously received prenatal care. If so, she will be treated with antiretroviral drugs right away. Sometimes these drugs will be given through a vein (IV). - If the first positive test is during labor, receiving ART right away during labor can reduce the rate of infection in children to about 10%. TREATING BABIES AND INFANTS Infants born to infected mothers start receiving ART within 6 to 12 hours after birth. One or more antiretroviral drugs should be continued for at least 6 weeks after birth. BREASTFEEDING HIV-positive women should not breastfeed. This holds true even for women who are taking HIV medicines. Doing so may pass HIV to the baby through breast milk.

But not all cancer can be cured. Sometimes treatment stops working or the cancer reaches a stage where it cannot be treated. This is called advanced cancer. When you have advanced cancer, you move into a different stage of life. It is a time when you start to think about the end of life. This is not easy, but it does not mean you do not have options. Some people live for years with advanced cancer. Learning about advanced cancer and knowing your options can help you make decisions that work best for you. Taking Stock : Talk with your health care provider about what advanced cancer means for you. No two people are alike. Find out what your treatment options are, what you can expect from treatment, and what the outcome may be. You may want to talk this over with your family, or have a family meeting with your provider, so you can plan ahead together. Deciding About Treatment : You can still receive treatment when you have advanced cancer. But the goals will be different. Instead of curing cancer, treatment may help relieve symptoms and control cancer. This can help you be as comfortable as possible for as long as possible. It may also help you live longer. Your treatment choices may include: - Chemotherapy (chemo) - Immunotherapy - Targeted therapy - Hormone therapy Talk with your health care provider about your options and weigh the risks and benefits. Most cancer treatments have side effects that can affect the quality of your life. Some people decide that the side effects are not worth the small benefit from treatment. Other people choose to continue treatment for as long as possible. This is a personal decision you will need to make together with your provider. Other Treatment Choices : When standard treatments no longer work for your cancer, you still have some choices about what type of care you would like to get. Some options include: - Clinical trials. These are research studies that look for new ways to treat cancer. There are benefits and risks to being in a clinical trial, and each one has rules about who can participate. If you are interested, ask your doctor about clinical trials for your type of cancer. - Palliative care. This is treatment that helps prevent and treat symptoms and side effects from cancer. It can also help you with emotional and spiritual struggles while facing cancer. Palliative care can help improve your quality of life. You may receive this type of care at every stage of cancer treatment. - Hospice care. You may decide to choose hospice care if you are no longer seeking active treatment for your cancer. Hospice care aims to improve your symptoms and help you feel comfortable in the last months of life. - Home care. This is treatment in your home instead of a hospital. You may be able to manage your care and get the medical equipment you need right at home. You may have to pay for some services yourself. Check with your health plan to see what they cover. Dealing with Symptoms of Advanced Cancer : You may think that symptoms will get worse as cancer progresses. That is not always the case. You may have a few symptoms or none at all. Some common symptoms include: - Pain - Nausea and vomiting - Fatigue - Anxiety - Loss of appetite - Sleeping problems - Constipation - Confusion If you have any of these symptoms, it is important to tell your provider. DO NOT downplay symptoms. There are many treatments that can help you feel better. You should not have to be uncomfortable. Relieving symptoms can help you enjoy your life more fully. Coping With Your Feelings : As a person with cancer, you may have felt anger, denial, sadness, anxiety, grief, fear, or regret. These feelings may be even more intense now. It is normal to feel a range of emotions. How you deal with your feelings is up to you. Here are some things that may help. - Get support. Sharing your feelings with others can help make your emotions feel less intense. You can join a support group for people with cancer or meet with a counselor or clergy member. - Keep doing things you enjoy. Plan your day as you normally would and try to do things you enjoy. You could even take a class in something new. - Let yourself feel hopeful. Think of things every day to look forward to. By feeling hopeful, you can find acceptance, a sense of peace, and comfort. - Remember to laugh. Laughter can ease stress, help you relax, and connect you with others. Look for ways to bring humor into your life. Watch funny movies, read comic strips or humorous books, and try to see humor in the things around you. Planning for the End of Life : This is a hard topic for many people to think about. But you may feel better knowing you have taken steps to prepare for the end of life, whatever that means to you. Here are some ways you may want to plan ahead: - Createadvance directives. These are legal papers that outline the type of care you want or do not want to have. You can also choose someone to make medical decisions for you if you cannot make them yourself. This is called a health care proxy. Having your wishes known ahead of time can help you and your loved ones worry less about the future. - Get your affairs in order. It is a good idea to go through your papers and make sure important documents are all together. This includes your will, trusts, insurance records, and bank statements. Keep them in a safe deposit box or with your lawyer. Make sure the people who will manage your affairs know where these documents are. - Spend time with loved ones. Reach out to your spouse, siblings, children, or grandchildren and try to make lasting memories. You may want to give meaningful items to those you love. - Leave a legacy. Some people choose to create special ways to celebrate their lives. Consider making a scrapbook, making jewelry or art, writing poetry, planting a garden, making a video, or writing down memories from your past. It is not easy to face the end of your life. Yet living day-to-day and working to appreciate your life and the people around you can bring a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. This can help you make the most of the time you have.

1.90909090909	How bad can endometriosis get?	Living with endometriosis (Summary): You have a condition called endometriosis. Symptoms of endometriosis include: - Heavy menstrual bleeding - Bleeding between periods - Problems getting pregnant Having this condition can interfere with your social and work life. No one knows what causes endometriosis. There is also no cure. However, there are different ways to treat the symptoms. These treatments can also help relieve menstrual pain. Learning how to manage your symptoms can make it easier to live with endometriosis.
0.636363636364	How bad can endometriosis get?	What is Endometriosis?: Endometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of your womb (uterus) grow in other areas of your body. This can cause pain, heavy bleeding, bleeding between periods, and problems getting pregnant (infertility).
-0.909090909091	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (Causes): Every month, a woman&aposs ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period. Endometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your: - Ovaries - Bowel - Rectum - Bladder - Lining of your pelvic area It can grow in other areas of the body, too. These growths stay in your body, they do not shed when you have your period. But, like the cells in your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. They grow and bleed when you get your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. The buildup of blood and tissue in your body leads to pain and other symptoms. No one knows what causes endometriosis. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. Researchers think that the immune system in women with endometriosis may cause the condition. Endometriosis is common. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35. You are more likely to develop endometriosis if you: - Have a mother or sister with endometriosis - Started your period at a young age - Never had children - Have frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days - Have a closed hymen, which blocks the flow of menstrual blood during the period
0.727272727273	How bad can endometriosis get?	What is Endometriosis?: Endometriosis is a problem affecting a woman&aposs uterus - the place where a baby grows when she&aposs pregnant. Endometriosis is when the kind of tissue that normally lines the uterus grows somewhere else. It can grow on the ovaries, behind the uterus or on the bowels or bladder. Rarely, it grows in other parts of the body. This "misplaced" tissue can cause pain, infertility, and very heavy periods. The pain is usually in the abdomen, lower back or pelvic areas. Some women have no symptoms at all. Having trouble getting pregnant may be the first sign. The cause of endometriosis is not known. Pain medicines and hormones often help. Severe cases may need surgery. There are also treatments to improve fertility in women with endometriosis.
0.818181818182	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (Other Endometriosis FAQs): - If I have endometriosis, will I be able to get pregnant? Among women with fertility problems, endometriosis may occur in as many as 50%.1 But exactly how endometriosis causes infertility is not clear. Some evidence suggests that infertility is related to the extent of the endometriosis patches, because the patches can distort the pelvic anatomy. This would make it difficult for sperm to travel to the ovary or a fertilized egg to travel to the uterus.2,3 Other evidence suggests that the inflammation in the abdomen may disrupt ovulation or fertilization, or that the endometrium may not develop properly, hampering the attachment of the embryo to the uterus. There are treatments for endometriosis-related infertility that may help women get pregnant even with endometriosis. - Is endometriosis the same as endometrial cancer? Endometriosis and endometrial cancer are not the same. The word "endometrium" describes the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the inside of the uterus. Endometriosis itself is not a form of cancer. - Can endometriosis lead to cancer? There is a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer among women with endometriosis, particularly among women who were diagnosed with the condition at an early age. However, it is unclear whether endometriosis causes ovarian cancer or if the two conditions share risk factors or disease mechanisms that make them more likely to occur together.3,4 In some cases, women with endometriosis also have breast cancer or non-Hodgkin&aposs lymphoma. However, these situations are rare.5 - Does endometriosis ever go away? For about one-quarter of women diagnosed with endometriosis, endometriosis patches go away on their own.6 Also, after menopause, symptoms of endometriosis typically lessen because there is a drop in the woman&aposs natural hormones and the growths gradually shrink. However, this is not true for all women. If a woman takes hormones for menopausal symptoms, both her pain symptoms and the growths may return. Women with endometriosis who are experiencing symptoms, especially after menopause, should talk with their health care providers about treatment options.
0.545454545455	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (When to Contact a Medical Professional): Call your provider if: - You have symptoms of endometriosis - Back pain or other symptoms reoccurring after endometriosis is treated You may want to get screened for endometriosis if: - Your mother or sister has the disease - You are unable to become pregnant after trying for 1 year
2.0	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (Possible Complications): Endometriosis can lead to problems getting pregnant. However, most women with mild symptoms can still get pregnant. Laparoscopy to remove growths and scar tissue may help improve your chances of becoming pregnant. If it does not, you may want to consider fertility treatments. Other complications of endometriosis include: - Long-term pelvic pain that interferes with social and work activities - Large cysts in the pelvis that may break open (rupture) In rare cases, endometriosis tissue may block the intestines or urinary tract. Very rarely, cancer may develop in the areas of tissue growth after menopause.
0.454545454545	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis: Endometriosis happens when the lining of the uterus (womb) grows outside of the uterus. It may affect more than 11% of American women between 15 and 44.1 It is especially common among women in their 30s and 40s and may make it harder to get pregnant. Several different treatment options can help manage the symptoms and improve your chances of getting pregnant. Endometriosis, sometimes called "endo," is a common health problem in women. It gets its name from the word endometrium(en-doh-MEE-tree-um), the tissue that normally lines the uterus or womb. Endometriosis happens when this tissue grows outside of your uterus and on other areas in your body where it doesn&apost belong. Most often, endometriosis is found on the: Other sites for growths can include the vagina, cervix, vulva, bowel, bladder, or rectum. Rarely, endometriosis appears in other parts of the body, such as the lungs, brain, and skin. Symptoms of endometriosis can include: Endometriosis growths are benign (not cancerous). But they can still cause problems. Endometriosis happens when tissue that is normally on the inside of your uterus or womb grows outside of your uterus or womb where it doesn&apost belong. Endometriosis growths bleed in the same way the lining inside of your uterus does every month - during your menstrual period. This can cause swelling and pain because the tissue grows and bleeds in an area where it cannot easily get out of your body. The growths may also continue to expand and cause problems, such as: Endometriosis is a common health problem for women. Researchers think that at least 11% of women, or more than 6 1/2 million women in the United States, have endometriosis.1 Endometriosis can happen in any girl or woman who has menstrual periods, but it is more common in women in their 30s and 40s. You might be more likely to get endometriosis if you have: No one knows for sure what causes this disease. Researchers are studying possible causes: You can&apost prevent endometriosis. But you can reduce your chances of developing it by lowering the levels of the hormone estrogen in your body. Estrogen helps to thicken the lining of your uterus during your menstrual cycle. To keep lower estrogen levels in your body, you can: If you have symptoms of endometriosis, talk with your doctor. The doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and do or prescribe one or more of the following to find out if you have endometriosis: There is no cure for endometriosis, but treatments are available for the symptoms and problems it causes. Talk to your doctor about your treatment options. If you are not trying to get pregnant, hormonal birth control is generally the first step in treatment. This may include: Hormonal treatment works only as long as it is taken and is best for women who do not have severe pain or symptoms. If you are trying to get pregnant, your doctor may prescribe a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. This medicine stops the body from making the hormones responsible for ovulation, the menstrual cycle, and the growth of endometriosis. This treatment causes a temporary menopause, but it also helps control the growth of endometriosis. Once you stop taking the medicine, your menstrual cycle returns, but you may have a better chance of getting pregnant. Surgery is usually chosen for severe symptoms, when hormones are not providing relief or if you are having fertility problems. During the operation, the surgeon can locate any areas of endometriosis and may remove the endometriosis patches. After surgery, hormone treatment is often restarted unless you are trying to get pregnant. Other treatments you can try, alone or with any of the treatments listed above, include: Learn more about endometriosis treatments. For some women, the painful symptoms of endometriosis improve after menopause. As the body stops making the hormone estrogen, the growths shrink slowly. However, some women who take menopausal hormone therapy may still have symptoms of endometriosis. If you are having symptoms of endometriosis after menopause, talk to your doctor about treatment options. Yes. Many women with endometriosis get pregnant. But, you may find it harder to get pregnant. Endometriosis affects about one-half (50%) of women with infertility.6 No one knows exactly how endometriosis might cause infertility. Some possible reasons include:7 If you have endometriosis and are having trouble getting pregnant, talk to your doctor. He or she can recommend treatments, such as surgery to remove the endometrial growths.7 Research shows a link between endometriosis and other health problems in women and their families.

-0.818181818182	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (What causes endometriosis? ​): The exact cause of endometriosis is not known, but researchers have some theories.The female reproductive organs are shown with red patches representing endometriosis. The arrows indicate that the menstrual flow is going backwards into the fallopian tubes instead of out of the body as it should.One theory suggests that endometriosis may result from something called "retrograde menstrual flow," in which some of the tissue that a woman sheds during her period flows through her fallopian tubes into her pelvis. While most women have some retrograde menstrual flow during their periods, not all of these women have endometriosis. Researchers are trying to uncover what other factors might cause the tissue to attach and grow in some women, but not in others.1,2​Researchers believe that endometriosis likely results from a combination of factors, including (but not limited to) some of the following:- Because endometriosis runs in families, genes are probably involved with endometriosis to some degree. - Estrogen (a hormone involved in the female reproductive cycle) also likely contributes to endometriosis, because endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease. - In endometriosis, the endometrium may not respond as it should to progesterone, another hormone involved in the female reproductive cycle. This means that the endometrium has "progesterone resistance." - In some cases of endometriosis, the immune system fails to destroy endometrial tissue, which enables it to grow outside the uterus. This means immune system dysfunction plays a role in these cases. - Environmental exposures in the womb, such as to chemicals like dioxin and organochlorine pesticides, have also been linked to developing endometriosis.1,2NICHD’s Endometriosis: Natural History, Diagnosis, and Outcomes (ENDO) Study conducted by the Division of Intramural Population Health Research examines risk factors associated with endometriosis. The study has found evidence of increased risk of endometriosis associated with environmental exposures:- Exposure to certain phthalates (chemicals used in plastics and other everyday products)3 - Exposure to certain industrial chemicals called “persistent organochlorine pollutants”4 - Exposure to some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAAs)5 - A specific ultraviolet filter (sunscreen) used in cosmetics6 - High urine concentrations of chromium and copper7
0.363636363636	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (What are the symptoms of endometriosis?): The primary symptoms of endometriosis are pain and infertility.- Among women with pelvic pain, endometriosis may occur in about 75%.1,2 - Among women with fertility problems, endometriosis may occur in as many as 50%.1Other common symptoms of endometriosis include:- Painful, even debilitating, menstrual cramps, which may get worse over time - Pain during or after sex - Pain in the intestine or lower abdomen - Painful bowel movements or painful urination during menstrual periods - Heavy menstrual periods - Premenstrual spotting or bleeding between periodsIn addition, women who are diagnosed with endometriosis may have painful bladder syndrome, digestive or gastrointestinal symptoms similar to a bowel disorder, as well as fatigue, tiredness, or lack of energy.2For some women, the pain symptoms associated with endometriosis get milder after menopause, but this is not always the case. Hormone therapy such as estrogen or birth control pills, given to reduce menopausal symptoms, may cause these endometriosis symptoms to continue.Researchers know that pain is a primary symptom of endometriosis, but it is not known how pain arises in women with endometriosis.The severity of pain does not correspond with the number, location, or extent of endometriosis lesions. Some women with only a few small lesions experience severe pain; other women may have very large patches of endometriosis, but only experience little pain.3,4Current evidence suggests several possible explanations for pain associated with endometriosis, including (but not limited to):3,4- Patches of endometriosis respond to hormones in a similar way as the lining of the uterus. These tissues may bleed or have evidence of inflammation every month, similar to a regular menstrual period. However, the blood and tissue shed from endometriosis patches stay in the body and are irritants, which can cause pain. - In some cases, inflammation and chemicals produced by the endometriosis areas can cause the pelvic organs to adhere, or stick together, causing scar tissue. This makes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum, appear as one large organ. - Hormones and chemicals released by endometriosis tissue also may irritate nearby tissue and cause the release of other chemicals known to cause pain. - Over time, some endometriosis areas may form nodules or bumps as they create lesions on the surface of pelvic organs or can become cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. - Some endometriosis lesions have nerves in them, tying the patches directly into the central nervous system. These nerves may be more sensitive to pain-causing chemicals released in the lesions and surrounding areas. Over time, they may be more easily activated by the chemicals than normal nerve cells are. - Patches of endometriosis might also press against nearby nerve cells to cause pain. - Some women report less endometriosis pain after pregnancy, but the reason for this is unclear. Researchers are trying to determine if the reduction results from the hormones released by the body during pregnancy, or from changes in the cervix, uterus, or endometrium that occur during pregnancy and delivery.Pain from endometriosis can be severe, interfering with day-to-day activities. Understanding how endometriosis is related to pain is a very active area of research because it could allow for more effective treatments for this specific type of pain.
0.272727272727	How bad can endometriosis get?	Endometriosis (Symptoms): The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain, often associated with your menstrual period. Although many women experience cramping during their menstrual period, women with endometriosis typically describe menstrual pain that&aposs far worse than usual. They also tend to report that the pain increases over time. Common signs and symptoms of endometriosis may include: - Painful periods (dysmenorrhea). Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before your period and extend several days into your period. You may also have lower back and abdominal pain. - Pain with intercourse. Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis. - Pain with bowel movements or urination. You&aposre most likely to experience these symptoms during your period. - Excessive bleeding. You may experience occasional heavy periods (menorrhagia) or bleeding between periods (menometrorrhagia). - Infertility. Endometriosis is first diagnosed in some women who are seeking treatment for infertility. - Other symptoms. You may also experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods. The severity of your pain isn&apost necessarily a reliable indicator of the extent of the condition. Some women with mild endometriosis have intense pain, while others with advanced endometriosis may have little pain or even no pain at all. Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping. IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis. See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that may indicate endometriosis. Endometriosis can be a challenging condition to manage. An early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary medical team and an understanding of your diagnosis may result in better management of your symptoms.

2.0	I am 23yr boy,i have knock knees i want treatment. Please help me.	Knock knees: Knock knees are condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. The legs turn inward. Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother&aposs womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) - Osteomyelitis (bone infection) - Overweight or obesity - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases. If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe. Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease. If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Complications may include: - Difficulty walking (very rare) - Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees - If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees.

1.0	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Nose fracture: A nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose. A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider&aposs attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include: - Blood coming from the nose - Bruising around the eyes - Difficulty breathing through the nose - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down) - Pain - Swelling The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens: - Try to stay calm. - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding. - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn&apost too much pressure on the nose. - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if: - Bleeding will not stop - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose - You suspect a blood clot in the septum - You suspect a neck or head injury - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades. Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving. Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

Potential objects placed in the nose may include food, seeds, dried beans, small toys (such as marbles), crayon pieces, erasers, paper wads, cotton, and beads. A foreign body in a child&aposs nose can be there for awhile without a parent being aware of the problem. The object may only be discovered when visiting a health care provider to find the cause of irritation, bleeding, infection, or difficulty breathing. Symptoms that your child may have a foreign body in his or her nose include: - Difficulty breathing through the affected nostril - Feeling of something in the nose - Foul-smelling or bloody nasal discharge - Irritability, particularly in infants - Irritation or pain in the nose - DO NOT search the nose with cotton swabs or other tools. This may push the object further into the nose. - DO NOT use tweezers or other tools to remove an object that is stuck deep inside the nose. - DO NOT try to remove an object that you cannot see or one that is not easy to grasp. This can push the object farther in or cause damage. - Have the person breathe through the mouth. The person should not breathe in sharply. This may force the object in further. - Gently press and close the nostril that does NOT have the object in it. Ask the person to blow gently. This may help push the object out.  Avoid blowing the nose too hard or repeatedly. - If this method fails, get medical help. Get medical help right away if: - The person cannot breathe well - Bleeding occurs and continues for more than 2 or 3 minutes after you remove the foreign object, despite placing gentle pressure on the nose - An object is stuck in both nostrils - You cannot easily remove a foreign object from the person&aposs nose - You think an infection has developed in the nostril where the object is stuck Prevention measures may include: - Cut food into appropriate sizes for small children. - Discourage talking, laughing, or playing while food is in the mouth. - Do not give foods such as hot dogs, whole grapes, nuts, popcorn, or hard candy to children under age 3. - Keep small objects out of the reach of young children. - Teach children to avoid placing foreign objects into their noses and other body openings.  Updated by: Jacob L.

-0.3	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	What to do for Nose fracture?: - Try to stay calm. - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn&apost too much pressure on the nose. - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol).
-1.8	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Bifid nose: A bifid nose is a relatively uncommon malformation that is characterized by the nose being divided into two parts. There is a large degree of variability in the severity of the condition, ranging from a minimally noticeable groove down the center of the nasal tip to a complete clefting of the underlying bones and cartilage, resulting in 2 complete half noses. [1] [2] It is often associated with hypertelorbitism and midline clefts of the lip. [1] The airway usually is adequate despite the cosmetic appearance associated with the condition. [2] Both autosomal recessive  and autosomal dominant  inheritance of a bifid nose has been observed. [3] It may also occur with  frontonasal dysplasia (a condition in with several possible findings limited to the head and neck), for which several inheritance patterns have been reported. [4] Treatment typically consists of surgical reconstruction to repair the malformation. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hypertelorism Occasional Abnormality of the kidney - Abnormality of the skeletal system - Anteriorly placed anus - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid nose - Bulbous nose - Cryptorchidism - Ptosis - Rectovaginal fistula - Short philtrum - View complete list of signs and symptoms... The role of genetics in being born with a bifid nose is not completely understood. There have been reports in the literature consistent with several different patterns of inheritance for a bifid nose. Inheritance patterns consistent with  autosomal recessive inheritance and  autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported both for individuals with only a bifid nose as well as for individuals with a bifid nose and additional abnormalities. [3] [5] Ocular hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes) is occasionally associated with bifid nose but the genetics of the combination has been unclear. For frontonasal dysplasia, a condition that includes several potential abnormalities limited to the head and neck (including a bifid nose), both  autosomal recessive and  X-linked dominant inheritance has been observed, as well as sporadic cases (occurring in individuals with no history of the condition in the family). [4] For another condition called bifid nose with or without anorectal and renal anomalies, autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested, and there has been evidence that  mutations in the FREM1 gene cause this particular condition. [6] Individuals interested in learning more about the genetics of a particular trait or condition, or their specific risk to have a child or other family member with a condition, should speak with a genetics professional.
-0.4	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	What to do for Nose fracture?: - Do NOT try to straighten a broken nose. - Do NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury.
-1.5	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Stuffy or runny nose - children: A stuffy or congested nose occurs when the tissues lining the nose become swollen. The swelling is due to inflamed blood vessels. The problem may also include nasal discharge or "runny nose." If excess mucus runs down the back of your throat (postnasal drip), it may cause a cough or sore throat. Most of the time, nasal congestion in older children and adolescents is not serious by itself, but can cause other problems. When nasal stuffiness is just on one side, the child may have inserted something into the nose. Nasal congestion can interfere with the ears, hearing, and speech development. Congestion that is very bad may interfere with sleep. The mucous drainage may plug up the eustachian tube between the nose and the ear, causing an ear infection and pain. The mucous drip may also plug the sinus passages, causing sinus infection and pain. A stuffy or runny nose may be caused by: - Common cold - Flu - Sinus infection The congestion typically goes away by itself within a week. Congestion also can be caused by: - Hay fever or other allergies - Use of some nasal sprays or drops bought without a prescription for more than 3 days (may make nasal stuffiness worse) - Nasal polyps, sac-like growths of inflamed tissue lining the nose or sinuses - Pregnancy - Vasomotor rhinitis - Small objects in the nostril Tips to help infants and younger children include: - Raise the head of your child&aposs bed. Put a pillow underneath the head of the mattress. Or, place books or boards under the legs at the head of the bed. - Older children may drink extra fluids, but those fluids should be sugar-free. - You can try a cool-mist vaporizer, but avoid putting too much moisture in the room. Clean the vaporizer every day with bleach or Lysol. - You can also steam up the bathroom shower and bring your child in there before bed. A nasal wash can help remove mucus from your child&aposs nose. - You can buy a saline spray at a drugstore or make one at home. To make one, use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of warm water, 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and a pinch of baking soda. - Use gentle saline nasal sprays 3 to 4 times per day. If your child has allergies: - Your health care provider may also prescribe nasal sprays that treat allergy symptoms. - Learn how to avoid triggers that make allergies worse. Nasal sprays are not recommended for children under age 2. Don&apost use over-the-counter nasal sprays more often than 3 days on and 3 days off, unless told to by your provider. You can buy cough and cold medicines without a prescription. They do not seem to be effective in children. Call the provider if your child has any of the following: - A stuffy nose with swelling of the forehead, eyes, side of the nose, or cheek, or that occurs with blurred vision - More throat pain, or white or yellow spots on the tonsils or other parts of the throat - Discharge from the nose that has a bad smell, comes from only one side, or is a color other than white or yellow - Cough that lasts longer than 10 days, or produces yellow-green or gray mucus - Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks - Nasal discharge with fever Your child&aposs provider may perform a physical exam that focuses on the ears, nose, throat, and airways. Tests that may be done include: - Allergy tests skin and blood tests - Blood tests (such as CBC or blood differential) - Sputum culture and throat culture - X-rays of the sinuses and chest x-ray - CT scan of the head Updated by: Linda J.

0.9	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Broken nose: A broken nose, also called a nasal fracture, is a break or crack in a bone in your nose - often the bone over the bridge of your nose. Common causes of a broken nose include contact sports, physical fights, falls and motor vehicle accidents that result in facial trauma. A broken nose can cause pain, along with swelling and bruising around your nose and under your eyes. Your nose may look crooked, and you may have trouble breathing. Treatment for a broken nose may include procedures that realign your nose. Surgery usually isn&apost necessary for a broken nose. Signs and symptoms of a broken nose: - Pain or tenderness, especially when touching your nose - Swelling of your nose and surrounding areas - Bleeding from your nose - Bruising around your nose or eyes - Crooked or misshapen nose - Difficulty breathing through your nose - Discharge of mucus from your nose - Feeling that one or both of your nasal passages are blocked When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical attention if you experience a nose injury accompanied by: - A head or neck injury, which may be marked by severe headache, neck pain, vomiting or loss of consciousness - Difficulty breathing - Bleeding you can&apost stop - A noticeable change in the shape of your nose that isn&apost related to swelling, such as a crooked or twisted appearance - Clear, watery fluid draining from your nose Common causes of a broken nose include: - Injury from contact sports, such as football or hockey - Physical altercations - Motor vehicle accidents - Falls A broken nose can even be caused by walking into a fixed object, such as a door or wall, or by rough, wrestling-type play. Any activity that increases your risk of a facial injury increases your risk of a broken nose. Such activities may include: - Playing contact sports, such as football and hockey, especially without a helmet that has a face mask - Engaging in a physical fight - Riding a bicycle - Lifting weights, especially if you don&apost use a spotter - Riding in a motor vehicle, especially without a seat belt Complications or injuries related to a broken nose may include: - Deviated septum. A nose fracture may cause a deviated septum, a condition that occurs when the thin wall dividing the two sides of your nose (nasal septum) is displaced, narrowing your nasal passage. Medications, such as decongestants and antihistamines, can help you manage a deviated septum, but surgery is required to correct the condition. - Collection of blood. Sometimes, pools of clotted blood form in a broken nose, creating a condition called a septal hematoma. A septal hematoma can block one or both nostrils. Septal hematoma requires prompt surgical drainage to prevent cartilage damage. - Cartilage fracture. If your fracture is due to a forceful blow, such as from an automobile accident, you also may experience a cartilage fracture. If your injury is severe enough to warrant surgical treatment, the surgeon should address both your bone and cartilage injuries. - Neck injury. Likewise, nose fractures resulting from high-velocity injuries - like those experienced in motor vehicle accidents - may be accompanied by injuries to your neck. If a blow is strong enough to break your nose, it may also be strong enough to damage the bones in your neck. If you suspect a neck injury, see your doctor immediately. Your doctor may press gently on the outside of your nose and its surrounding areas. He or she may look inside your nasal passage to check for obstruction and further signs of broken bones. Your doctor may use anesthetics - either a nasal spray or local injections - to make you more comfortable during the exam. X-rays and other imaging studies are usually unnecessary. However, your doctor may recommend a computerized tomography (CT) scan if the severity of your injuries makes a thorough physical exam impossible or if your doctor suspects you may have other injuries. If you have a minor fracture that hasn&apost caused your nose to become crooked or otherwise misshapen, you may not need professional medical treatment. Your doctor may recommend simple self-care measures, such as using ice on the area and taking over-the-counter pain medications. Fixing displacements and breaks Your doctor may be able to realign your nose manually, or you may need surgery. Manual realignment If the break has displaced the bones and cartilage in your nose, your doctor may be able to manually realign them. This needs to be done within 14 days from when the fracture occurred, preferably sooner. During this procedure, your doctor: - Administers medication by injection or nasal spray to ease discomfort - Opens your nostrils with a nasal speculum - Uses special instruments to help realign your broken bones and cartilage Your doctor will also splint your nose using packing in your nose and a dressing on the outside. Sometimes, an internal splint is also necessary for a short time. The packing usually needs to stay in for a week. You&aposll also be given a prescription for antibiotics to prevent infection with the bacteria that may normally reside in your nose. Surgery Severe breaks, multiple breaks or breaks that have gone untreated for more than 14 days may not be candidates for manual realignment. In these cases, surgery to realign the bones and reshape your nose may be necessary. If the break has damaged your nasal septum, causing obstruction or difficulty breathing, reconstructive surgery may be recommended. Surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis. If you think you may have broken your nose, take these steps to reduce pain and swelling before seeing your doctor: - Act quickly. When the break first occurs, breathe through your mouth and lean forward to reduce the amount of blood that drains into your throat. - Use ice. Apply ice packs or cold compresses immediately after the injury, and then at least four times a day for the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce swelling. Keep the ice or cold compress on for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Wrap the ice in a washcloth to prevent frostbite. Try not to apply too much pressure, which can cause additional pain or damage to your nose. - Relieve pain. Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), as necessary. - Keep your head up. Elevate your head - especially when sleeping - so as not to worsen swelling and throbbing. - Limit your activities. For the first two weeks after treatment, don&apost play any sports. Avoid contact sports for at least six weeks after your injury.
0.8	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Rhinoplasty: Rhinoplasty is surgery to repair or reshape the nose. Rhinoplasty can be performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on the exact procedure and the person&aposs preference. It is performed in a surgeon&aposs office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 2 hours. It may take longer. With local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation. The surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils. In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This type of cut is used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a cartilage graft. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the side of the nose to break, and reshape the bone. A splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished. Soft plastic splints or nasal packs also may be placed in the nostrils. This helps keep the dividing wall between the air passages (septum) stable. Rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. It can be used to: - Reduce or increase the size of the nose - Change the shape of the tip or the nasal bridge - Narrow the opening of the nostrils - Change the angle between the nose and the upper lip - Correct a birth defect or injury - Help relieve some breathing problems Nose surgery is considered elective when it is done for cosmetic reasons. In these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the person finds more desirable. Many surgeons prefer to perform cosmetic nose surgery after the nasal bone has finished growing. This is around age 14 or 15 for girls and a bit later for boys. Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are: - Reactions to medicines, problems breathing - Bleeding, infection, or bruising Risks for this procedure include: - Loss of support of the nose - Contour deformities of the nose - Need for further surgery After surgery, tiny blood vessels that have burst may appear as tiny red spots on the skin surface. These are usually minor, but are permanent. There are no visible scars if the rhinoplasty is performed from inside the nose. If the procedure narrows flared nostrils, there may be small scars at the base of the nose that are not often visible. In rare cases, a second procedure is needed to fix a minor deformity. Your surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery. You may need to: - Stop any medicines that thin your blood. Your surgeon will give you a list of these medicines. - See your regular health care provider to have some routine tests and make sure it is safe for you to have surgery. - To aid with healing, stop smoking 2 to 3 weeks before and after surgery. - Arrange to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery. Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches are common. The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable. The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks. Full recovery takes several weeks. Healing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some swelling and numbness for months. You may not be able to see the final results for up to a year. Updated by: David A.

-1.9	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Fractured clavicle in the newborn: A fractured clavicle in the newborn is a broken collar bone in a baby that was just delivered. A fracture of a newborn&aposs collar bone (clavicle) can occur during a difficult vaginal delivery. The baby will not move the painful, injured arm. Instead, the baby will hold it still against the side of the body. Lifting the baby under the arms causes the child pain. Sometimes, the fracture can be felt with the fingers, but the problem often can&apost be seen or felt. Within a few weeks, a hard lump may develop where the bone is healing. This lump may be the only sign that the newborn had a broken collar bone. A chest x-ray will show whether or not there is a broken bone. Generally, there is no treatment other than lifting the child gently to prevent discomfort. Occasionally, the arm on the affected side may be immobilized, most often by simply pinning the sleeve to the clothes. Full recovery occurs without treatment. Most often, there are no complications. Because infants heal well, it may be impossible (even by x-ray) to tell that a fracture occurred. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your baby acts uncomfortable when you lift him or her. Updated by: Neil K.

-1.6	I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now	Rhinophyma: Rhinophyma is a large, red-colored (ruddy) nose. The nose has a bulb shape. Rhinophyma was once thought to be caused by heavy alcohol use. This is not correct. Rhinophyma occurs equally in people who DO NOT use alcohol and in those who drink heavily. The problem is much more common in men than in women. The cause of rhinophyma is unknown. It may be a severe form of a skin disease called rosacea. It is an uncommon disorder. Symptoms include changes in the nose, such as: - Bulb-like (bulbous) shape - Many oil glands - Reddish color (possible) - Thickening of the skin - Waxy, yellow surface Most of the time, a health care provider can diagnose rhinophyma without any tests. Sometimes a skin biopsy may be needed. The most common treatment is surgery to reshape the nose. Surgery may be done with a laser, scalpel, or rotating brush (dermabrasion). Certain acne medicines may also be helpful in treating the condition. Rhinophyma can be corrected with surgery. The condition may return. Rhinophyma can cause emotional distress. This is because of the way it looks. Call your provider if you have symptoms of rhinophyma and would like to talk about treatment. Updated by: David L.

0.75	I have been battling Anal fissure for close to two years now and it has refused to heal all these while. Please what do you suggest i do? Thanks	Anal fissure (Treatment): Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you&aposll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence.

0.875	I have been battling Anal fissure for close to two years now and it has refused to heal all these while. Please what do you suggest i do? Thanks	Anal fissure (Treatment): Most fissures heal on their own and do not need treatment. To prevent or treat anal fissures in infants, be sure to change diapers often and clean the area gently. CHILDREN AND ADULTS Worrying about pain during a bowel movement may cause a person to avoid them. But not having bowel movements will only cause the stools to become even harder, which can make anal fissure worse. Prevent hard stools and constipation by: - Making dietary changes -- eating more fiber or bulk, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains - Drinking more fluids - Using stool softeners Ask your provider about the following ointments or creams to help soothe the affected skin: - Numbing cream, if pain interferes with normal bowel movements - Petroleum jelly - Zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, Preparation H, and other products A sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing. Sit in the bath 2 to 3 times a day. The water should cover only the hips and buttocks. If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, treatment may involve: - Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter) - Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle - Prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles
2.0	I have been battling Anal fissure for close to two years now and it has refused to heal all these while. Please what do you suggest i do? Thanks	Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn&aposs disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren&apost sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn&aposs disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you&aposve experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure&aposs location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn&aposs disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you&aposre younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you&aposll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter.

Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child&aposs doctor.

Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you&aposre younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea.

Don&apost try to treat an ingrown nail at home. Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home: - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry. - Gently massage over the inflamed skin. - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton or floss with water or antiseptic. When trimming your toenails: - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. - Use a clean, sharp trimmer. - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short.  - Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse. Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem. If this doesn&apost work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist), or a skin specialist (dermatologist). If the ingrown nail doesn&apost heal or keeps coming back, your provider may remove part of the nail: - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe. - The ingrown part of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion. - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow. If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. After the procedure, follow any instructions for helping your nail heal.

Kartagener syndrome: Kartagener syndrome is a type of p that is also characterized by situs inversus totalis (mirror-image reversal of internal organs ). The signs and symptoms vary but may include neonatal respiratory distress; frequent lung, sinus and middle ear infections beginning in early childhood; and infertility. [1] [2] [3] It can be cause by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although scientists have identified many of the genes associated with Kartagener syndrome, the genetic cause of some cases is unknown. [4] [2] There is no cure for Kartagener syndrome. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include airway clearance therapy and antibiotics . [1] [2] [3] Kartagener syndrome is characterized by p and situs inversus totalis. In people affected by situs inversus totalis, the internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen and intestine are on the opposite side of the body. Although the internal organs are abnormally placed, this condition typically does not cause any health problems. [1] [2] The signs and symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia vary, but may include: [1] [2] [3] Neonatal respiratory distress Frequent respiratory infections that can lead to severe lung damage Chronic nasal congestion Frequent sinus infections Recurrent middle ear infections, particularly in early childhood Hearing loss Hydrocephalus Infertility Kartagener syndrome can be caused by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes . These genes encode proteins that are important to the structure and function of cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that are found on the surface of cells in various parts of the body such as the lining of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs . The coordinated movement of cilia in wave-like motions is important to the normal functioning of certain organs and tissues throughout the body and ensures the proper placement of organs in the developing embryo. Mutations in these genes cause the cilia to be either immotile (unable to move) or dysmotile (they move incorrectly), which leads to the many signs and symptoms of Kartagener syndrome. [1] [4] [3] Scientists have identified several different genes that are associated with Kartagener syndrome; however, the genetic cause is unknown in some cases. [1] [4] [3] Kartagener syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [4] This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell . The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Kartagener syndrome is typically suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. A diagnosis can be confirmed by examining a small sample of tissue ( biopsy ) from an area of the body known to have cilia such as the sinus cavities or the airway. Abnormalities in the structure of cilia, as seen in people affected by Kartagener syndrome, can be observed under a special microscope (called an electron microscope). If the disease-causing change ( mutation ) is known, genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis. [1] [2] [3] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is currently no cure for Kartagener syndrome . Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Airway clearance therapy, similar to that used in cystic fibrosis, can loosen thick, sticky mucus so it can be cleared away. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat respiratory, sinus, and middle ear infections and may be given on a long-term basis in people with chronic or frequent infections. Surgery to insert ear tubes may be recommended in children with chronic ear infections that are resistant to antibiotics. In people with severe lung disease, lung transplantation may be an option.

Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions. The long-term outlook for people with Kartagener syndrome varies widely and largely depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Chronic childhood infections can be very debilitating. However, with appropriate treatment, the progression of lung disease can be slowed and other complications such as hearing loss can be avoided. [3] [2] [5]

Cushing Syndrome (Other FAQs): Are there disorders or conditions associated with Cushing’s syndrome? - Persistent fatigue - Muscle weakness - Abdominal and facial weight gain - Depression - Mood swings - High blood pressure - High blood sugar Health care providers can prescribe medication or other therapy to reduce these symptoms. What’s the difference between Cushing’s syndrome and Cushing’s disease? Individuals with Cushing’s disease have Cushing’s syndrome symptoms. However, because their symptoms are caused specifically by a pituitary gland tumor (adenoma) that produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), the condition is called Cushing’s disease. About 70% of tumor-driven Cushing’s syndrome cases are caused by Cushing’s disease. Can Cushing’s syndrome lead to cancer? Some benign or malignant tumors cause Cushing’s syndrome. In rare cases, these tumors can spread to other parts of the body if they are not detected and treated in time. It is unknown whether Cushing’s syndrome makes it more likely for cancer to develop. Scientists are working to understand more about how stress (which makes the body produce cortisol) or taking medicines containing cortisol may disrupt the body’s immune system. If one partner has Cushing’s syndrome, can the couple still get pregnant? Cushing’s syndrome can affect fertility in both men and women. Women The high levels of cortisol in Cushing’s syndrome disrupt a woman’s ovaries. Her menstrual periods may stop completely or become irregular. As a result, women with Cushing’s syndrome almost always have difficulty becoming pregnant. For those who do become pregnant, the risk of miscarriage is high. In rare cases, usually when a woman’s Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a benign adrenal tumor, pregnancy can occur, but it brings high risk for the mother and fetus. After a woman is treated for Cushing’s syndrome, her ovaries often recover from the effects of too much cortisol. Her regular menstrual cycles will return, and she can become pregnant. In some women, regular periods do not return after they are treated for Cushing’s syndrome. This occurs if surgery removes the part of the pituitary gland involved in reproduction. An infertility specialist can prescribe hormone therapy to bring back regular periods, ovulation, and fertility. Men A man diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome may have a decline in sperm production and could have reduced fertility. He also might experience a lowered sex drive as well as impotence (pronounced IM-puh-tuhns). In addition, some medications used to treat Cushing’s syndrome can reduce fertility. However, fertility usually recovers after Cushing’s syndrome is cured and treatment has stopped. Does Cushing’s syndrome affect pregnancy? Cushing’s syndrome can cause serious and potentially life-threatening effects for the mother and the fetus during pregnancy. For example, Cushing’s syndrome raises a woman’s risk of developing pregnancy-related high blood pressure (called preeclampsia, pronounced pree-i-KLAMP-see-uh, or eclampsia) and/or pregnancy diabetes, which also is called gestational (pronounced je-STEY-shuhn-ul) diabetes). Infection and slow healing of any wounds are more likely, as is heart failure. When the syndrome is caused by a tumor, it will be surgically removed as early as possible to reduce any threat. « What are the treatments?​​

Usher syndrome: Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. Sensorineural  Three major types of Usher syndrome have been described - types I, II, and III. The different types are distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and symptoms appear. All three types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [1] Treatment for the hearing loss may include hearing aids or surgery for a cochlear implant. Vitamin A palmitate is useful for treating the vision loss in people with Usher syndrome type II. Researchers have identified three major types of Usher syndrome , designated as types I, II, and III. These types are distinguished mainly by their severity, and the age when signs and symptoms appear. These types are also further divided into subtypes. [1] retinitis pigmentosa Usher syndrome type II characterized by:  Hearing loss  from birth, usually milder than type I and mainly affects high tones. Children with Usher syndrome type II have problems hearing high, soft, speech sounds such as those of the letters "d" and "t." The degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition.  Progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. Absence of any balance or equilibrium problems. Usher syndrome type III characterized by:  Progressive hearing loss which begins during the first few decades of life. Therefore, unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, infants with Usher syndrome type III are usually born with normal hearing. Hearing loss typically begins during the first two decades of life, after the development of speech, and progresses over time. By middle age, most affected individuals are profoundly deaf. Progressive vision loss developing in late childhood or adolescence. Variable balance issues, due to vestibular system problems.

Many of the genes related to Usher syndrome give instructions to make proteins needed for normal hearing, balance, and vision. The signs and symptoms of Usher syndrome occur when these genes have mutations that impair how they function. In some cases, the exact role of the genes involved is unknown. In some cases no mutation is identified, and it is believed that other genes may be involved. [1] Usher syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [1] This means that a person must have a disease-causing change ( mutation ) in both copies of the gene associated with the syndrome in each cell to have Usher syndrome. One mutated copy is typically inherited from each parent, who are each referred to as a carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition usually do not have any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to not be a carrier  AND not be affected.

The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells.

This gene provides instructions for making the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) protein, which transports negatively charged atoms (anions) across cell membranes. Specifically, AE1 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for negatively charged bicarbonate molecules (bicarbonate ions). The AE1 protein is found in the cell membrane of kidney cells and red blood cells. In kidney cells, the exchange of bicarbonate through AE1 allows acid to be released from the cell into the urine. In red blood cells, AE1 attaches to other proteins that make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of the cells, helping to maintain their structure. The SLC4A1 gene mutations involved in either form of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis lead to production of altered AE1 proteins that cannot get to the correct location in the cell membrane. In the autosomal dominant form of the condition, gene mutations affect only one copy of the SLC4A1 gene, and normal AE1 protein is produced from the other copy. However, the altered protein attaches to the normal protein and keeps it from getting to the correct location, leading to a severe reduction or absence of AE1 protein in the cell membrane. In autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis, both copies of the SLC4A1 gene are mutated, so all of the protein produced from this gene is altered and not able to get to the correct location. Improper location or absence of AE1 in kidney cell membranes disrupts bicarbonate exchange, and as a result, acid cannot be released into the urine. Instead, the acid builds up in the blood in most affected individuals, leading to metabolic acidosis and the other features of complete distal renal tubular acidosis. It is not clear why some people develop metabolic acidosis and others do not. Researchers suggest that in individuals with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, another mechanism is able to help regulate blood acidity (pH) and keep metabolic acidosis from developing. In red blood cells, interaction with a protein called glycophorin A can often help the altered AE1 protein get to the cell membrane where it can perform its function, which explains why most people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis do not have blood cell abnormalities. However, some altered AE1 proteins cannot be helped by glycophorin A and are not found in the cell membrane. Without AE1, the red blood cells are unstable; breakdown of these abnormal red blood cells may lead to hemolytic anemia. Some people have nonhereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis; these forms can be caused by immune system problems or other conditions that damage the kidneys. These individuals often have additional signs and symptoms related to the original condition.

It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SLC4A1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means a mutation must occur in both copies of the SLC4A1 gene for the condition to develop. This pattern occurs with certain types of SLC4A1 gene mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
2.0	I have been researching Lewy Body Disease and have a few questions.1) Is this disease hereditary2) Does alcoholism play a role in the beginning process of this disease3) What are the initial symptoms of the diseaseAny information you could forward would be greatly appreciated.	Lewy body dementia: Lewy body dementia is one of the most common forms of progressive dementia. People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein ("Lewy bodies") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however, medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called "Lewy bodies") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE ε4 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE ε2 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging.

Lewy body dementia (Symptoms): Lewy body dementia signs and symptoms may include: - Visual hallucinations. Hallucinations may be one of the first symptoms, and they often recur. They may include seeing shapes, animals or people that aren&apost there. Sound (auditory), smell (olfactory) or touch (tactile) hallucinations are possible. - Movement disorders. Signs of Parkinson&aposs disease (parkinsonian symptoms), such as slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk may occur. - Poor regulation of body functions (autonomic nervous system). Blood pressure, pulse, sweating and the digestive process are regulated by a part of the nervous system that is often affected by Lewy body dementia. This can result in dizziness, falls and bowel issues such as constipation. - Cognitive problems. You may experience thinking (cognitive) problems similar to those of Alzheimer&aposs disease, such as confusion, poor attention, visual-spatial problems and memory loss. - Sleep difficulties. You may have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, which can cause you to physically act out your dreams while you&aposre asleep. - Fluctuating attention. Episodes of drowsiness, long periods of staring into space, long naps during the day or disorganized speech are possible. - Depression. You may experience depression sometime during the course of your illness. - Apathy. You may have loss of motivation.

Tay-Sachs disease (Treatment): There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, but some treatments can help in managing symptoms. The goal of treatment is support and comfort. Supportive treatments include: - Medication. To reduce your child&aposs symptoms, a number of prescription medications are available, including anti-seizure medications. - Respiratory care. Children who have Tay-Sachs disease are at high risk of lung infections that cause breathing problems and frequently accumulate mucus in their lungs. Your child may need the mucus using chest physiotherapy (CPT) to help remove mucus from the lungs. - Feeding tubes. Your child may have trouble swallowing, or develop respiratory problems by inhaling food or liquid into the lungs while eating. To prevent those problems, your doctor may recommend an assistive feeding device such as a gastrostomy tube, which is inserted through your child&aposs nose and goes to your child&aposs stomach. Or, a doctor trained in stomach surgery may surgically insert an esophagogastrostomy tube. - Physical therapy. As the disease progresses, your child may benefit from physical therapy to help keep joints flexible and maintain as much ability to move (range of motion) as possible. Physical therapy can delay joint stiffness and reduce or delay the loss of function and pain that can result from shortened muscles. Potential future treatments Gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy research may eventually lead to a cure or treatment to slow the progression of Tay-Sachs disease.

Tay-Sachs Disease: Tay-Sachs disease is a inherited metabolic disease caused by the harmful buildup of lipids (fatty materials such as oils and acids) in various cells and tissues in the body.  It is part of a group of genetic disorders called the GM2 gangliosidoses.  Tay-Sachs and its variant form are caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase A.  Affected children appear to develop normally until about age 6 months.  Then, symptoms begin and include progressive loss of mental ability, dementia, blindness, increased startle reflex to noise, progressive loss of hearing leading to deafness, and difficulty with swallowing.  Seizures may begin in the child&aposs second year. Persons with Tay-Sachs also have "cherry-red" spots in their eyes.  A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired.  A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4, from recurring infection.
1.85714285714	My daughter has menkes syndrome and would like to know how to go about. Thx	Menkes syndrome: In Menkes syndrome, cells in the body can absorb copper, but they are unable to release it. It is one of several conditions called an "inborn error of metabolism." Menkes syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute copper in food from the intestines into the bloodstream for use in other areas. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper. Copper can build up in the small intestine and kidneys, but low copper levels in other areas can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function. Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X-chromosome, so if a mother carries the defective gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome are: - Bone spurs - Brittle, kinky hair - Feeding difficulties - Irritability - Lack of muscle tone, floppiness - Low body temperature - Mental deterioration - Pudgy, rosy cheeks - Seizures - Skeletal changes There is often a history of Menkes syndrome in a male relative. Signs include: - Abnormal appearance of the hair under a microscope - Abnormally low body temperature - Bleeding in the brain - Slow growth in the womb In males, all of the hairs will be abnormal. In females who carry this trait, half of them may have areas of abnormal hair. Tests may include: - Serum ceruloplasmin (substance that transports copper in the blood) - Serum copper level - Skin cell culture - X-ray of the skeleton or x-ray of the skull Genetic testing may show a change (mutation) in the ATP7A gene. Treatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease. Injections of copper into a vein or under the skin have been used with mixed results. Most people with this condition die within the first few years of life. - Seizures - Death Talk to your health care provider if you have a family history of Menkes syndrome and you plan to have children. A baby with this condition will often show symptoms early in infancy. See a genetic counselor if you want to have children and you have a family history of Menkes syndrome. Maternal relatives (relatives on the mother&aposs side of the family) of a boy with this syndrome should be seen by a geneticist to find out if they are carriers.

2.0	My daughter has menkes syndrome and would like to know how to go about. Thx	What is Menkes syndrome?: Menkes syndrome is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.

0.571428571429	My daughter has menkes syndrome and would like to know how to go about. Thx	ATP7A gene (Menkes syndrome): Researchers have identified more than 150 mutations in the ATP7A gene that cause Menkes syndrome. Many of these mutations delete part of the gene and likely result in a shortened ATP7A protein. Other mutations insert additional DNA building blocks (nucleotides) into the gene or change single nucleotides. All of these mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein. As a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The abnormal protein may get stuck in the cell membrane and become unable to shuttle back and forth from the Golgi apparatus. The disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to be poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes.

Since this is such a rare disorder, and to honor his memory, I would like to distribute literature at his funeral service.	Cardiac amyloidosis (Causes): Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloids build up in body tissues. Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis ("stiff heart syndrome") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block). The condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.

Cardiac amyloidosis (Outlook (Prognosis)): In the past, cardiac amyloidosis was thought to be an untreatable and rapidly fatal disease. However, the field is changing rapidly. Different types of amyloidosis can affect the heart in different ways. Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis.

Since this is such a rare disorder, and to honor his memory, I would like to distribute literature at his funeral service.	Cardiac amyloidosis (Treatment): Your health care provider may tell you to make changes to your diet, including limiting salt and fluids. You may need to take water pills (diuretics) to help your body get rid of excess fluid. The provider may tell you to weigh yourself every day. A weight gain of 3 or more pounds (1 kilogram or more) over 1 to 2 days can mean there is too much fluid in the body. Medicines including digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers may be used in people with atrial fibrillation. However, the drugs must be used with caution, and the dosage must be carefully monitored. People with cardiac amyloidosis may be extra sensitive to side effects of these drugs. Other treatments may include: - Chemotherapy - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) - Pacemaker, if there are problems with heart signals - Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medicine A heart transplant may be considered for people with some types of amyloidosis who have very poor heart function. People with hereditary amyloidosis may need a liver transplant.

Management is typically conservative and usually successful in most people. [3] Management of lymphedema should be guided by a lymphedema therapist. Some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Good skin care is essential. These measures may improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected areas, decrease their size, and reduce the risk of complications. [2] Decongestive physiotherapy , which combines compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage (a specialized massage technique), exercise, breathing exercises, dietary measures and skin care, has become the standard of care for primary lymphedema. [3] People with recurrent cellulitis may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics . [2] [3] Surgical intervention is considered a last option when other medical management fails.

Walk or do another activity to the point of pain and alternate it with rest periods. Over time, your circulation may improve as new, small (collateral) blood vessels form. Always talk to the doctor before starting an exercise program. - Stop smoking. Smoking narrows the arteries, decreases the blood&aposs ability to carry oxygen, and increases the risk of forming clots (thrombi and emboli). - Take care of your feet, especially if you also have diabetes. Wear shoes that fit properly. Pay attention to any cuts, scrapes, or injuries, and see your doctor right away. Tissues heal slowly and are more likely to get infected when there is decreased circulation. - Make sure your blood pressure is well-controlled. - If you are overweight, reduce your weight. - If your cholesterol is high, eat a low-cholesterol and low-fat diet. - Monitor your blood sugar level if you have diabetes, and keep it under control. Medicines may be needed to control the disorder, including: - Aspirin or a medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix), which keeps your blood from forming clots in your arteries. DO NOT stop taking these medications without first talking with your doctor. - Cilostazol, a drug that works to enlarge (dilate) the affected artery or arteries for moderate-to-severe cases that are not candidates for surgery. - Medicine to help lower your cholesterol. - Pain relievers. If you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or diabetes, take them as your doctor has prescribed. Surgery may be performed if the condition is severe and is affecting your ability to work or do important activities, or you are having pain at rest. Options are: - Angioplasty and stent placement of the peripheral arteries (this is similar to the technique used to open the coronary arteries, but it is performed on the blood vessels of the affected leg) - Peripheral artery bypass surgery of the leg Some people with PAD may need to have the limb removed (amputated).

The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body. Impaired transport with accumulation of lymph fluid can cause swelling (lymphedema). Individuals with Milroy disease typically have lymphedema in their lower legs and feet at birth or develop it in infancy. The lymphedema typically occurs on both sides of the body and may worsen over time. Milroy disease is associated with other features in addition to lymphedema. Males with Milroy disease are sometimes born with an accumulation of fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele). Males and females may have upslanting toenails, deep creases in the toes, wart-like growths (papillomas), and prominent leg veins. Some individuals develop non-contagious skin infections called cellulitis that can damage the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). Episodes of cellulitis can cause further swelling in the lower limbs. Milroy disease is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the FLT4 gene cause some cases of Milroy disease. The FLT4 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), which regulates the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system. Mutations in the FLT4 gene interfere with the growth, movement, and survival of cells that line the lymphatic vessels (lymphatic endothelial cells). These mutations lead to the development of small or absent lymphatic vessels. If lymph fluid is not properly transported, it builds up in the body&aposs tissues and causes lymphedema. It is not known how mutations in the FLT4 gene lead to the other features of this disorder. Many individuals with Milroy disease do not have a mutation in the FLT4 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Milroy disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In many cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new mutations in the FLT4 gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. About 10 percent to 15 percent of people with a mutation in the FLT4 gene do not develop the features of Milroy disease.

[2] Swelling varies in degree and distribution, and can be disabling and disfiguring. [3] For some people the outlook depends on how chronic the lymphedema is, as well as whether complications arise. [4] However, Milroy disease is rarely associated with significant complications. [3] The degree of edema sometimes progresses, but in some cases can improve (particularly in early years). [2] Complications of lymphedema may include recurrent bouts of cellulitis and/or lymphangitis, bacterial and fungal infections, deep venous thrombosis, functional impairment, cosmetic embarrassment, and amputation. Complications following surgery are common. [4] It has also been reported that people with chronic lymphedema for many years may have a significantly higher risk to develop lymphangiosarcoma (a type of angiosarcoma). This type of tumor is highly aggressive and has a very poor prognosis . [4]

People with this condition have particularly short forearms and lower legs and a narrow chest with short ribs. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is also characterized by the presence of extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), malformed fingernails and toenails, and dental abnormalities. More than half of affected individuals are born with a heart defect, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although affected individuals have less pronounced short stature and typically do not have heart defects. The two conditions are caused by mutations in the same genes.

It is difficult to estimate the exact prevalence because the disorder is very rare in the general population. This condition is much more common in the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and in the indigenous (native) population of Western Australia.
0.6	more information in relation to Ellis van creveld syndrome Specifically in later life can they have children has it ever been reported any researchcarried out and just as much information as possible to help my understanding of what I have Many thanks	EVC gene: The EVC gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. However, it appears to be important for normal growth and development, particularly the development of bones and teeth. The EVC protein is found in primary cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. In particular, the EVC protein is thought to help regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog, which plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body. EVC and another gene, EVC2, are located very close together on chromosome 4. Researchers believe that the two genes may have related functions and that their activity may be coordinated. More than 25 mutations in the EVC gene have been reported to cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by dwarfism, abnormal nails and teeth, and heart defects. The mutations that cause this condition occur in both copies of the EVC gene in each cell. These genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the EVC protein or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. Although it is unclear how the loss of this protein&aposs function underlies the signs and symptoms of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, researchers believe that it may prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo. Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition.

Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition. At least one mutation in the EVC gene has been found to cause the characteristic features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, affecting the development of the teeth, nails, and bones. The signs and symptoms of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis are similar to, but typically milder than, those of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome. The EVC gene mutation that causes Weyers acrofacial dysostosis occurs in one copy of the gene in each cell. It changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the EVC protein, replacing the amino acid serine with the amino acid proline at position 307 (written as Ser307Pro). It is unclear how this genetic change leads to the specific features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Studies suggest that the abnormal protein interferes with Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the normal formation and growth of the teeth, nails, and bones.

The condition itself is not treatable, but many of the complications can be treated.
1.85714285714	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	Nephrotic syndrome (Treatment): The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and delay kidney damage. To control nephrotic syndrome, the disorder that is causing it must be treated. You may need treatment for life. Treatments may include any of the following: - Keeping blood pressure at or below 130/80 mm Hg to delay kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the medicines most often used. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also help decrease the amount of protein lost in the urine. - Corticosteroids and other drugs that suppress or quiet the immune system. - Treating high cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel problems. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is usually not enough for people with nephrotic syndrome. Medicines to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides (usually statins) may be needed. - A low-salt diet may help with swelling in the hands and legs. Water pills (diuretics) may also help with this problem. - Low-protein diets may be helpful. Your health care provider may suggest a moderate-protein diet (1 gram [gm] of protein per kilogram [kg] of body weight per day). - Taking vitamin D supplements if nephrotic syndrome is long-term and is not responding to treatment. - Taking blood thinner drugs to treat or prevent blood clots.
2.0	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	What causes Nephrotic syndrome?: Nephrotic syndrome is caused by different disorders that damage the kidneys. This damage leads to the release of too much protein in the urine. The most common cause in children is minimal change disease. Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common cause in adults.In both diseases, the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged. Glomeruli are the structures that help filter wastes and fluids. This condition can also occur from: - Cancer - Diseases such as diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis - Genetic disorders - Immune disorders - Infections (such as strep throat, hepatitis, or mononucleosis) - Use of certain drugs It can occur with kidney disorders such as: - Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis - Glomerulonephritis - Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis Nephrotic syndrome can affect all age groups. In children, it is most common between ages 2 and 6. This disorder occurs slightly more often in males than females.
-1.28571428571	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

-1.42857142857	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	Generalized anxiety disorder - self-care (Therapy): Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist and in a safe place. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it. Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people&aposs behavior or life events. - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones. Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.
-1.57142857143	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	Targeted therapies for cancer (Who may get Targeted Therapy?): There are targeted therapies that can treat certain types of these cancers: - Leukemia and lymphoma - Breast cancer - Colon cancer - Skin cancer - Lung cancer - Prostate Other cancers that may be treated with targeted therapies include brain, bone, kidney, lymphoma, stomach, and many others. Your provider will decide whether targeted therapies may be an option for your type of cancer. In most cases, you may receive targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy. You may receive these drugs as part of your regular treatment, or as part of a clinical trial.
-1.71428571429	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	Prostate cancer - treatment (Hormonal Therapy): Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body&aposs testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment.
-1.85714285714	What is Nephrotic Syndrome. What are its causes and cures?	Immunotherapy for cancer: Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body&aposs infection-fighting system (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells. Immunotherapy works by: - Stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells - Preventing cancer from spreading to other parts of the body - Boosting the immune system&aposs ability to get rid of cancer cells There are several types of immunotherapy for cancer. The immune system protects the body from infection. It does this by detecting germs such as bacteria or viruses and making proteins that fight infection. These proteins are called antibodies. Scientists can make special antibodies in a lab that seek out cancer cells instead of bacteria. Called monoclonal antibodies, they are also a type of targeted therapy. Some monoclonal antibodies work by sticking to cancer cells. This makes it easier for other cells made by the immune system to find, attack, and kill the cells. Other monoclonal antibodies work by blocking signals on the surface of the cancer cell that tell it to divide. Another type of monoclonal antibody carries radiation or a chemotherapy drug to cancer cells. These cancer-killing substances are attached to the monoclonal antibodies, which then deliver the toxins to the cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies treat several different types of cancer: - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma - Hodgkin lymphoma - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma - Advanced melanoma - Stomach cancer - Breast cancer - Advanced colon or rectal cancer - Kidney cancer - Certain types of brain cancer - Cancers of the head and neck "Checkpoints" are specific molecules on certain immune cells that the immune system either turns on or turns off to create an immune response. Cancer cells can use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a newer type of monoclonal antibody that act on these checkpoints to boost the immune system so it can attack cancer cells. PD-1 inhibitors are used to treat: - Melanoma of the skin - Non-small cell lung cancer - Kidney cancer - Hodgkin lymphoma PD-L1 inhibitors treat bladder cancer and are being tested against other types of cancer. Drugs that target CTLA-4 treat melanoma of the skin. These therapies boost the immune system in more general way than monoclonal antibodies. There are two main types: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps immune cells grow and divide more quickly. A lab-made version of IL-2 is used for advanced forms of kidney cancer and melanoma. Interferon alpha (INF-alfa) makes certain immune cells better able to attack cancer cells. It is used to treat: - Hairy cell leukemia - Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma - Cutaneous (skin) T-cell lymphoma - Kidney cancer - Melanoma - Kaposi sarcoma This type of therapy uses viruses that have been altered in a lab to infect and kill cancer cells. When these cells die, they release substances called antigens. These antigens tell the immune system to target and kill other cancer cells in the body. This type of immunotherapy is still in the very early stages of development. Currently this type of therapy is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is being tested on other types of cancer. The side effects for different types of immunotherapy for cancer differ by the type of treatment. Some side effects occur where the injection or IV enters the body, causing the area to be: - Sore or painful - Swollen - Red - Itchy Other possible side effects include: - Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, headache) - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Muscle or joint aches - Feeling very tired - Headache - Low or high blood pressure These therapies can also cause a severe, sometimes fatal, allergic reaction in people sensitive to certain ingredients in the treatment. However, this is very rare. Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL. Review provided by VeriMed Healthcare Network.

1.0	When and how do you know when you have congenital night blindness?	autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells&apos ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

0.75	When and how do you know when you have congenital night blindness?	X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB) is a disorder of the retina. People with this condition typically experience night blindness and other vision problems, including loss of sharpness ( reduced visual acuity), severe nearsightedness (myopia), nystagmus , and strabismus . Color vision is typically not affected. These vision problems are usually evident at birth, but tend to be stable (stationary) over time. There are two major types of XLCSNB: the complete form and the incomplete form. Both types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of macular pigmentation Frequent Nyctalopia Frequent Optic disc hypoplasia Frequent Reduced visual acuity Frequent Severe Myopia Frequent Nystagmus Occasional Strabismus Occasional Congenital stationary night blindness - Hemeralopia - X-linked recessive inheritance - Yes. About 45% of individuals with XLCSNB have the complete form, which is caused by mutations in the NYX gene . The other 55% have the incomplete form, which is caused by mutations in the CACNA1F gene. [2] The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional. Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.
-0.75	When and how do you know when you have congenital night blindness?	Vision - night blindness: Night blindness is poor vision at night or in dim light. Night blindness may cause problems with driving at night. People with night blindness often have trouble seeing stars on a clear night or walking through a dark room, such as a movie theater. These problems are often worse just after a person is in a brightly lit environment. Milder cases may just have a harder time adapting to darkness. The causes of night blindness fall into 2 categories: treatable and nontreatable. Treatable causes: - Cataracts - Nearsightedness - Use of certain drugs - Vitamin A deficiency (rare) Nontreatable causes: - Birth defects - Retinitis pigmentosa Take safety measures to prevent accidents in areas of low light. Avoid driving a car at night, unless you get your eye doctor&aposs approval. Vitamin A supplements may be helpful if you have a vitamin A deficiency. Ask your health care provider. It is important to have a complete eye exam to determine the cause, which may be treatable. Call your eye doctor if symptoms of night blindness persist or significantly affect your life. Your provider will examine you and your eyes. The goal of the medical exam is to determine if the problem can be corrected (for example, with new glasses or cataract removal), or if the problem is due to something that is not treatable. The provider may ask you questions, including: - How severe is the night blindness? - When did your symptoms start? - Did it occur suddenly or gradually? - Does it happen all the time? - Does using corrective lenses improve night vision? - Have you ever had eye surgery? - What medicines do you use? - How is your diet? - Have you recently injured your eyes or head? - Do you have a family history of diabetes? - Do you have other vision changes? - What other symptoms do you have? - Do you have unusual stress, anxiety, or a fear of the dark? The eye exam will include: - Color vision testing - Pupil light reflex - Refraction - Retinal exam - Slit lamp examination - Visual acuity Other tests may be done: - Electroretinogram (ERG) - Visual field Updated by: Franklin W.

You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apost pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&aposre resting - When you&aposre lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apost go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apost work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&aposs common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apost do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apost pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apost wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apost go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

Along with the aches and pains of pregnancy, you will feel other new or changing symptoms. Even so, many pregnant women say that they feel healthier than ever. Being tired is common during pregnancy. Most women feel tired the first few months, then again toward the end. Exercise, rest, and a proper diet can make you feel less tired. It may also help to take rest breaks or naps every day. Early on in the pregnancy, you will likely be making more trips to the bathroom. - As your uterus grows and rises higher in your abdomen (belly), the need to urinate often may lessen. - Even so, you will continue to urinate more throughout pregnancy. That means that you also need to drink more water, and may be thirstier than before you were pregnant. - As you get closer to delivery and your baby descends into your pelvis, you will need to pee much more, and the amount of urine passed at one time will be less (the bladder holds less due to pressure from the baby). If you have pain when you urinate or a change in urine odor or color, call your health care provider. These could be signs of a bladder infection. Some pregnant women also leak urine when they cough or sneeze. For most women, this goes away after the baby is born. If this happens to you, start doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. You may see more vaginal discharge while pregnant. Call your provider if the discharge: - Has a foul odor - Has a greenish color - Makes you feel itchy - Causes pain or soreness Having a hard time moving the bowels is normal during pregnancy. This is because: - Hormone changes during pregnancy slow down your digestive system. - Later in your pregnancy, the pressure from your uterus on your rectum may also worsen the problem. You can ease constipation by: - Eating raw fruits and vegetables, such as prunes, to get extra fiber. - Eating whole grain or bran cereals for more fiber. - Using a fiber supplement regularly. - Drinking plenty of water (8 to 9 cups daily). Ask your provider about trying a stool softener. Also ask before using laxatives during pregnancy. While you are pregnant, food stays in your stomach and bowels longer. This may cause heartburn (stomach acid moving back up into the esophagus). You can reduce heartburn by: - Eating small meals - Avoiding spicy and greasy foods - Not drinking large amounts of liquid before bedtime - Not exercising for at least 2 hours after you eat - Not lying down flat right after a meal If you continue to have heartburn, talk to your provider about medicines that can help. Some women have nose and gum bleeding while they are pregnant. This is because the tissues in their nose and gums get dry, and the blood vessels dilate and are closer to the surface. You can avoid or reduce this bleeding by: - Drinking lots of fluids - Getting lots of vitamin C, from orange juice or other fruits and juices - Using a humidifier (a device that puts water in the air) to decrease dryness of the nose or sinuses - Brushing your teeth with a soft toothbrush to decrease bleeding gums - Maintaining good dental hygiene and using floss every day to keep your gums healthy Swelling in your legs is common. You may see more swelling as you get closer to giving birth. The swelling is caused by your uterus pressing on the veins. - You may also notice that the veins in your lower body are becoming larger. - In the legs, these are called varicose veins. - You may also have veins close to your vulva and vagina that swell. - In your rectum, veins that swell are called hemorrhoids. To reduce swelling: - Raise your legs and rest your feet on a surface higher than your belly. - Lie on your side in bed. Lying on the left side is better if you can do it comfortably. It also provides better circulation for the baby. - Wear support pantyhose or compression stockings. - Limit salty foods. Salt works like a sponge and makes your body hold more water. - Try not to strain during bowel movements. This can worsen hemorrhoids. Leg swelling that occurs with headaches or high blood pressure can be a sign of a serious medical complication of pregnancy called preeclampsia. It is important to discuss leg swelling with your provider. Some women feel short of breath at times while they are pregnant. It happens more often in the early part of the pregnancy due to the changes in your hormones. It may also happen again toward the end of your pregnancy because of pressure from the baby. Mild shortness of breath from exercise that quickly gets better is not serious. Severe chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away can be a sign of a serious medical complication. Call 911 or go to an emergency room right away if you have these symptoms. You may get short of breath again in the later weeks of pregnancy. This is because the uterus takes up so much room that your lungs do not have as much space to expand. Doing these things might help with shortness of breath: - Sitting up straight - Sleeping propped up on a pillow - Resting when you feel short of breath - Moving at a slower pace If you suddenly have a hard time breathing that is unusual for you, see your provider right away or go to the emergency room.

Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body’s midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions ( chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. [1]  Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), a very small head ( microcephaly ), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve ( optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy.

2.0	Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?	Optic nerve atrophy: Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain. There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma. Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include: - Brain tumor - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis) - Multiple sclerosis - Stroke There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually, its ability to react to light may be lost. The health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of: - Color vision - Pupil light reflex - Tonometry - Visual acuity You may also need a complete physical exam and other tests. Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue. Rarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Vision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye. People with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions. Tell your doctor right away about any change in vision. Many causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented. Prevention steps include: - Older adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure. - Use standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face. Most facial injuries are the result of car accidents. Wearing seat belts may help prevent these injuries. - Schedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma. - Never drink home-brewed alcohol and forms of alcohol that are not intended for drinking. Methanol, which is found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes. Updated by: Franklin W. Lusby, MD, ophthalmologist, Lusby Vision Institute, La Jolla, CA.

-0.571428571429	Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?	What are the genetic changes related to optic atrophy type 1?: Optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene. The protein produced from this gene is made in many types of cells and tissues throughout the body. The OPA1 protein is found inside mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. The OPA1 protein plays a key role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The OPA1 protein is also involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. Additionally, the protein plays a role in the maintenance of the small amount of DNA within mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutations in the OPA1 gene lead to overall dysfunction of mitochondria. The structure of the mitochondria become disorganized and cells are more susceptible to self-destruction. OPA1 gene mutations lead to mitochondria with reduced energy-producing capabilities. The maintenance of mtDNA is also sometimes impaired, resulting in mtDNA mutations. The vision problems experienced by people with optic atrophy type 1 are due to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the breakdown of structures that transmit visual information from the eyes to the brain. Affected individuals first experience a progressive loss of nerve cells within the retina, called retinal ganglion cells. The loss of these cells is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerve. The optic nerve is partly made up of specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells called axons; when the retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerve cannot transmit visual information to the brain normally. It is unclear why the OPA1 gene mutations that cause optic atrophy type 1 only affect the eyes. Retinal ganglion cells have many mitochondria and especially high energy requirements, which researchers believe may make them particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreases in energy production. Some individuals with optic atrophy type 1 do not have identified mutations in the OPA1 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.

1.85714285714	Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?	Optic atrophy 1: Optic atrophy 1 is a condition that mainly affects vision, but may include other features. Vision loss typically begins within the first decade of life; severity varies widely among affected people (from nearly normal vision to complete blindness), even among members of the same family. Vision problems may include difficulty distinguishing colors, progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the optic nerve. Additional, less common abnormalities may include sensorineural hearing loss , ataxia , myopathy (muscle disease) and other neurological findings. [1] It is usually caused by  mutations in the OPA1 gene , although some individuals with optic atrophy 1 do not have identified mutations in this gene, in which case the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an  autosomal dominant pattern but some cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. [2] Treatment focuses on individual symptoms when possible. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions. A thorough search of available literature provided very limited information about how optic atrophy 1 may affect life expectancy. A recent study discussed how extra-ocular neurological complications may be more common than previously thought in individuals with an OPA1 gene mutation and may affect up to 20% of individuals. The authors of the study described new clinical features including spastic paraplegia (stiffness of the legs) and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. [3] Ongoing research and follow-up of individuals with the condition may provide specific information about life expectancy in the future. Vision loss alone is not expected to substantially shorten the life span; however, severe neurological symptoms, when present, theoretically may contribute to a shortened life span in some individuals.

0.714285714286	Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?	optic atrophy type 1: Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that often causes slowly worsening vision, usually beginning in childhood. People with optic atrophy type 1 typically experience a narrowing of their field of vision (tunnel vision). Affected individuals gradually lose their sight as their field of vision becomes smaller. Both eyes are usually affected equally, but the severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from nearly normal vision to complete blindness. In addition to vision loss, people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green. In the early stages of the condition, individuals with optic atrophy type 1 experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerves), which results in further vision loss. Atrophy causes these nerves to have an abnormally pale appearance (pallor), which can be seen during an eye examination. Optic atrophy type 1 is estimated to affect 1 in 35,000 people worldwide. This condition is more common in Denmark, where it affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people. Optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene. The protein produced from this gene is made in cells and tissues throughout the body. The OPA1 protein is found within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. The protein plays a key role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in controlled cell death (apoptosis). The OPA1 protein is also involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. Additionally, the protein plays a role in the maintenance of the DNA within mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutations in the OPA1 gene lead to problems with mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. The maintenance of mtDNA may also be impaired, resulting in mtDNA mutations that further interfere with mitochondrial energy production. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria are more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, cells that have high energy demands, such as retinal ganglion cells, die over time. Specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells, called axons, form the optic nerves, so when retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves atrophy and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In rare cases, people who have an OPA1 gene mutation do not develop optic atrophy type 1, a situation known as reduced penetrance. Delettre-Cribaillet C, Hamel CP, Lenaers G.

Rheumatoid arthritis (Symptoms): Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don&apost involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints.
-0.75	Are there any researches indicating how early an individual may experience any signs or symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?	What are the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?: Swelling and Pain in the Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joint lining. This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. A person also feels sick, tired, and sometimes feverish. Rheumatoid arthritis generally occurs in a symmetrical pattern. If one knee or hand is affected, the other one is also likely to be affected. Diagnostic Tests Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages for several reasons. There is no single test for the disease. In addition, symptoms differ from person to person and can be more severe in some people than in others. Common tests for rheumatoid arthritis include - The rheumatoid factor test. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is present eventually in the blood of most people with rheumatoid arthritis However, not all people with rheumatoid arthritis test positive for rheumatoid factor, especially early in the disease. Also, some people who do test positive never develop the disease. The rheumatoid factor test.

Also, some people who do test positive never develop the disease. - The citrulline antibody test. This blood test detects antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP). This test is positive in most people with rheumatoid arthritis and can even be positive years before rheumatoid arthritis symptoms develop. When used with the rheumatoid factor test, the citrulline antibody test results are very useful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. The citrulline antibody test.

Diagnosis Can Take Time Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be similar to those of other types of arthritis and joint conditions, and it may take some time to rule out other conditions. The full range of symptoms develops over time, and only a few symptoms may be present in the early stages. Learn more about how rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed.
2.0	Are there any researches indicating how early an individual may experience any signs or symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?	Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body&aposs tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don&apost involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don&apost know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don&apost actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you&aposve had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn&apost an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you&aposre just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don&apost do any moves that cause pain.
-0.625	Are there any researches indicating how early an individual may experience any signs or symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?	What are the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?: Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joint lining. This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. The pain of rheumatoid arthritis varies greatly from person to person, for reasons that doctors do not yet understand completely. Factors that contribute to the pain include swelling within the joint, the amount of heat or redness present, or damage that has occurred within the joint.

Rheumatoid arthritis (Diagnosis): Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies.

0.625	Are there any researches indicating how early an individual may experience any signs or symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?	rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that causes chronic abnormal inflammation, primarily affecting the joints. The most common signs and symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. Small joints in the hands and feet are involved most often, although larger joints (such as the shoulders, hips, and knees) may become involved later in the disease. Joints are typically affected in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if joints in the hand are affected, both hands tend to be involved. People with rheumatoid arthritis often report that their joint pain and stiffness is worse when getting out of bed in the morning or after a long rest. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation of other tissues and organs, including the eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. Additional signs and symptoms of the condition can include a loss of energy, a low fever, weight loss, and a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Some affected individuals develop rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue that can grow under the skin and elsewhere in the body. The signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually appear in mid- to late adulthood. Many affected people have episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions) for the rest of their lives. In severe cases, affected individuals have continuous health problems related to the disease for many years. The abnormal inflammation can lead to severe joint damage, which limits movement and can cause significant disability. Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1.3 million adults in the United States. Worldwide, it is estimated to occur in up to 1 percent of the population. The disease is two to three times more common in women than in men, which may be related to hormonal factors. Rheumatoid arthritis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body&aposs own tissues and organs. In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system triggers abnormal inflammation in the membrane that lines the joints (the synovium). When the synovium is inflamed, it causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joint. In severe cases, the inflammation also affects the bone, cartilage, and other tissues within the joint, causing more serious damage. Abnormal immune reactions also underlie the features of rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body. Variations in dozens of genes have been studied as risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis. Most of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in immune system function. The most significant genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis are variations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, especially the HLA-DRB1 gene. The proteins produced from HLA genes help the immune system distinguish the body&aposs own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Changes in other genes appear to have a smaller impact on a person&aposs overall risk of developing the condition. Other, nongenetic factors are also believed to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis. These factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. Potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), occupational exposure to certain kinds of dust or fibers, and viral or bacterial infections. Long-term smoking is a well-established risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis; it is also associated with more severe signs and symptoms in people who have the disease. The inheritance pattern of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. However, having a close relative with rheumatoid arthritis likely increases a person&aposs risk of developing the condition. Carmona L, Cross M, Williams B, Lassere M, March L. Rheumatoid arthritis.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Summary): Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that can affect a woman&aposs menstrual cycle, ability to have children, hormones , heart, blood vessels, and appearance. Women with this condition typically have high levels of  hormones called androgens, missed or irregular periods, and many small cysts in their ovaries. The cause of PCOS is unknown, but probably involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Treatment for PCOS may involve birth control pills and medications for diabetes and infertility. Medicines called anti-androgens are also used to speed the growth of hair and clear acne. [1] [2]

-1.5	Polycystic ovarian syndrome Is it possible for parents to pass this on in the genes to their children - is there any other way this can be acquired?	Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) (How do genes cause it?): Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by mutations, or changes, in the FMR1 gene. The mutation affects how the body can use the gene to make the Fragile X mental retardation protein, or FMRP. On a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene normally includes many repeats—repeated instances of a trio of DNA bases called a triplet repeat—in this case, many copies of the CGG triplet repeat—to help build the protein. The number of repeats in the promoter varies from person to person. - People who do not have the FMR1 triplet repeat expansion usually have between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. - People whose FMR1 gene has between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation. - People whose FMR1 gene has more than 200 repeats have a full mutation. Effects of Premutations Versus Full Mutations Premutations and full mutations in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene can have different effects. Premutations can cause specific disorders taht aren&apost found in people with the full mutation: - Women with a premutation may have Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). - People with a premutation may also have Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome. The number of repeats in the promoter region also affects the severity of a person’s symptoms of Fragile X syndrome: - People with a premutation may have milder symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, or they may have no symptoms at all. - People with a full mutation are more likely to have intellectual and developmental disabilities and other symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. Parents who have a FMR1 premutation may have no symptoms but still pass along the premutation to their children. That means their children could have Fragile X-associated disorders, including FXPOI. Also, the premutation can expand when it&aposs passed along, so that a child of a parent with a premutation could have Fragile X syndrome. « What causes it? What are common symptoms? » ​​

This type of counselor helps people learn the risk of getting genetic conditions. They also help people make decisions about testing and what comes next. Scientists believe that many factors influence when Alzheimer&aposs disease begins and how it progresses.Increasing age is the most important known risk factor for Alzheimer&aposs. The number of people with the disease doubles every 5 years beyond age 65. About one-third of all people age 85 and older may have Alzheimer&aposs disease.The causes of late-onset Alzheimer&aposs, the most common form of the disease, probably include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of development Alzheimer&aposs may differ from person to person.Scientists are learning how age-related changes in the brain may harm nerve cells and contribute to Alzheimer&aposs damage. These age-related changes include atrophy (shrinking) of certain parts of the brain, inflammation, production of unstable molecules called free radicals, and breakdown of energy production within cells.As scientists learn more about this devastating disease, they realize that genes also play an important role.

Each human cell contains the instructions a cell needs to do its job. These instructions are made up of DNA, which is packed tightly into structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome has thousands of segments called genes.Genes are passed down from a person&aposs birth parents. They carry information that defines traits such as eye color and height. Genes also play a role in keeping the body&aposs cells healthy. Problems with genes-even small changes to a gene-can cause diseases like Alzheimer&aposs disease. Some diseases are caused by a genetic mutation, or permanent change in one or more specific genes. If a person inherits from a parent a genetic mutation that causes a certain disease, then he or she will usually get the disease. Sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset familial Alzheimer&aposs disease are examples of inherited genetic disorders.In other diseases, a genetic variant may occur. A single gene can have many variants. Sometimes, this difference in a gene can cause a disease directly. More often, a variant plays a role in increasing or decreasing a person&aposs risk of developing a disease or condition. When a genetic variant increases disease risk but does not directly cause a disease, it is called a genetic risk factor. There are two types of Alzheimer&aposs-early-onset and late-onset. Both types have a genetic component.Some Differences Between Late-Onset and Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Disease Late-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Signs first appear in a person&aposs mid-60s Signs first appear between a person&aposs 30s and mid-60s Most common type Very rare May involve a gene called APOE E4 Usually caused by gene changes passed down from parent to childLate-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseShare this infographic and help spread the word about Alzheimer&aposs genetics. Most people with Alzheimer&aposs have the late-onset form of the disease, in which symptoms become apparent in the mid-60s.Researchers have not found a specific gene that directly causes the late-onset form of the disease. However, one genetic risk factor-having one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on chromosome 19-does increase a person&aposs risk. APOE comes in several different forms, or alleles:- APOE E2 is relatively rare and may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE E4 gene. - APOE E3, the most common allele, is believed to play a neutral role in the disease-neither decreasing nor increasing risk. - APOE E4 increases risk for Alzheimer&aposs disease and is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset. A person has zero, one, or two APOE E4 alleles. Having more APOE E4 alleles increases the risk of developing Alzheimer&aposs.APOE E4 is called a risk-factor gene because it increases a person&aposs risk of developing the disease. However, inheriting an APOE E4 allele does not mean that a person will definitely develop Alzheimer&aposs. Some people with an APOE E4 allele never get the disease, and others who develop Alzheimer&aposs do not have any APOE E4 alleles.Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseEarly-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs between a person&aposs 30s to mid-60s and represents less than 10 percent of all people with Alzheimer&aposs. Some cases are caused by an inherited change in one of three genes, resulting in a type known as early-onset familial Alzheimer&aposs disease, or FAD. For other cases of early-onset Alzheimer&aposs, research suggests there may be a genetic component related to factors other than these three genes.A child whose biological mother or father carries a genetic mutation for early-onset FAD has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is in fact inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing early-onset FAD.Early-onset FAD is caused by any one of a number of different single gene mutations on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. Each of these mutations causes abnormal proteins to be formed. Mutations on chromosome 21 cause the formation of abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP). A mutation on chromosome 14 causes abnormal presenilin 1 to be made, and a mutation on chromosome 1 leads to abnormal presenilin 2.Each of these mutations plays a role in the breakdown of APP, a protein whose precise function is not yet fully understood. This breakdown is part of a process that generates harmful forms of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer&aposs disease. Research suggests that a host of factors beyond genetics may play a role in the development and course of Alzheimer&aposs disease. There is a great deal of interest, for example, in the relationship between cognitive decline and vascular conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure, as well as metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Ongoing research will help us understand whether and how reducing risk factors for these conditions may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer&aposs.A nutritious diet, physical activity, social engagement, and mentally stimulating pursuits have all been associated with helping people stay healthy as they age. These factors might also help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer&aposs disease. Clinical trials are testing some of these possibilities. Scientists believe that many factors influence when Alzheimer&aposs disease begins and how it progresses. The more they study this devastating disease, the more they realize that genes play an important role. Research conducted and funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and others is advancing our understanding of Alzheimer&aposs disease genetics.

This approach, called precision medicine, takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person. Alzheimer&aposs disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease. It is characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles; the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain; and the death of these nerve cells. There are two types of Alzheimer&aposs-early-onset and late-onset. Both types have a genetic component.What Are DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes? The nucleus of almost every human cell contains a "blueprint" that carries the instructions a cell needs to do its job. The blueprint is made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is present in long strands that would stretch to nearly 6 feet in length if attached end to end. The DNA is packed tightly together with proteins into compact structures called chromosomes. Normally, each cell has 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs, which are inherited equally from a person&aposs biological parents. The DNA in nearly all cells of an individual is identical. Each chromosome contains many thousands of segments, called genes. People inherit two copies of each gene from their parents, except for genes on the X and Y chromosomes, which, among other functions, determine a person&aposs sex. The genes "instruct" the cell to make unique proteins that, in turn, dictate the types of cells made. Genes also direct almost every aspect of the cell&aposs construction, operation, and repair. Even slight changes in a gene can produce a protein that functions abnormally, which may lead to disease. Other changes in genes may increase or decrease a person&aposs risk of developing a particular disease.Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseEarly-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs between a person&aposs 30s to mid-60s and represents less than 10 percent of all people with Alzheimer&aposs. Some cases are caused by an inherited change in one of three genes, resulting in a type known as early-onset familial Alzheimer&aposs disease, or FAD. For other cases of early-onset Alzheimer&aposs, research suggests there may be a genetic component related to factors other than these three genes.A child whose biological mother or father carries a genetic mutation for early-onset FAD has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is in fact inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing early-onset FAD.Early-onset FAD is caused by any one of a number of different single-gene mutations on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. Each of these mutations causes abnormal proteins to be formed. Mutations on chromosome 21 cause the formation of abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP). A mutation on chromosome 14 causes abnormal presenilin 1 to be made, and a mutation on chromosome 1 leads to abnormal presenilin 2.Each of these mutations plays a role in the breakdown of APP, a protein whose precise function is not yet fully understood. This breakdown is part of a process that generates harmful forms of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease.Critical research findings about early-onset Alzheimer&aposs have helped identify key steps in the formation of brain abnormalities typical of the more common late-onset form of Alzheimer&aposs. Genetics studies have helped explain why the disease develops in people at various ages.NIA-supported scientists are continuing research into early-onset disease through the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), an international partnership to study families with early-onset FAD. By observing the Alzheimer&aposs-related brain changes that occur in these families long before symptoms of memory loss or cognitive issues appear, scientists hope to gain insight into how and why the disease develops in both its early- and late-onset forms.In addition, an NIA-supported clinical trial in Colombia, South America, is testing the effectiveness of an amyloid-clearing drug in symptom-free volunteers at high risk of developing early-onset FAD.For more information, see NIA&aposs Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Disease: A Resource List.Late-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseMost people with Alzheimer&aposs have the late-onset form of the disease, in which symptoms become apparent in the mid-60s and later. The causes of late-onset Alzheimer&aposs are not yet completely understood, but they likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that affect a person&aposs risk for developing the disease.Researchers have not found a specific gene that directly causes the late-onset form of the disease. However, one genetic risk factor-having one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on chromosome 19-does increase a person&aposs risk.

Having more APOE epsilon4 alleles increases the risk of developing Alzheimer&aposs.APOE epsilon4 is called a risk-factor gene because it increases a person&aposs risk of developing the disease. However, inheriting an APOE epsilon4 allele does not mean that a person will definitely develop Alzheimer&aposs. Some people with an APOE epsilon4 allele never get the disease, and others who develop Alzheimer&aposs do not have any APOE epsilon4 alleles.Using a relatively new approach called genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers have identified a number of regions of interest in the genome (an organism&aposs complete set of DNA, including all of its genes) that may increase a person&aposs risk for late-onset Alzheimer&aposs to varying degrees. By 2015, they had confirmed 33 regions of interest in the Alzheimer&aposs genome.A method called whole genome sequencing determines the complete DNA sequence of a person&aposs genome at a single time. Another method called whole exome sequencing looks at the parts of the genome that directly code for the proteins. Using these two approaches, researchers can identify new genes that contribute to or protect against disease risk. Recent discoveries have led to new insights about biological pathways involved in Alzheimer&aposs and may one day lead to effective interventions. A blood test can identify which APOE alleles a person has, but results cannot predict who will or will not develop Alzheimer&aposs disease. It is unlikely that genetic testing will ever be able to predict the disease with 100 percent accuracy, researchers believe, because too many other factors may influence its development and progression.Currently, APOE testing is used in research settings to identify study participants who may have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer&aposs. This knowledge helps scientists look for early brain changes in participants and compare the effectiveness of treatments for people with different APOE profiles. Most researchers believe that APOE testing is useful for studying Alzheimer&aposs disease risk in large groups of people but not for determining any one person&aposs risk.Genetic testing is used by researchers conducting clinical trials and by physicians to help diagnose early-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. However, genetic testing is not otherwise recommended.Epigenetics: Nature Meets Nurture Scientists have long thought that genetic and environmental factors interact to influence a person&aposs biological makeup, including the predisposition to different diseases. More recently, they have discovered the biological mechanisms for those interactions. The expression of genes (when particular genes are "switched" on or off) can be affected-positively and negatively-by environmental factors at any time in life. These factors include exercise, diet, chemicals, or smoking, to which an individual may be exposed, even in the womb. Epigenetics is an emerging science focused on how and when particular genes are turned on or off. Diet and exposure to chemicals in the environment, among other factors, can alter a cell&aposs DNA in ways that affect the activity of genes. That can make people more or less susceptible to developing a disease. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to Alzheimer&aposs disease. Epigenetic changes, whether protective, benign, or harmful, may help explain, for example, why one family member develops the disease and another does not. Scientists are learning more about Alzheimer&aposs-related epigenetics, with the hope of developing individualized treatments based on epigenetic markers and their function. Discovering all that we can about the role of Alzheimer&aposs disease genetic risk and protective factors is an important area of research. Understanding more about the genetic basis of the disease will help researchers to:- Answer a number of basic questions-What makes the disease process begin? Why do some people with memory and other thinking problems develop Alzheimer&aposs while others do not? - Determine how genetic risk and protective factors may interact with other genes and lifestyle or environmental factors to affect Alzheimer&aposs risk in any one person. - Identify people who are at high risk for developing Alzheimer&aposs so they can benefit from new interventions and treatments as soon as possible. - Focus on new prevention and treatment approaches.Major Alzheimer&aposs Genetics Research Efforts Underway The National Institute on Aging supports several major genetics research programs. - The Alzheimer&aposs Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is an innovative collaboration between NIA and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both part of NIH. The first phase of the project determined the order of all 3 billion letters in the individual genomes of 580 participants. It also generated whole exome sequencing data for an additional 11,000 volunteers. - The Alzheimer&aposs Disease Genetics Consortium is a collaborative effort to collect and analyze genetic data from thousands of families around the world to identify genes associated with an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer&aposs. - The Late-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Disease Genetics Study is gathering and analyzing genetic and other information from 1,500 or more families in the United States with two or more members who have late-onset Alzheimer&aposs. - The International Genomic Alzheimer&aposs Project (IGAP) is comprised of four consortia in the United States and Europe that have been working together since 2011 on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving thousands of DNA samples and shared data sets. In a study of more than 74,000 individuals, IGAP recently reported the identification of 19 novel regions of interest that are associated with the disease. - The Genetics of Alzheimer&aposs Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) is a national genetics data repository that gives investigators access to data to study the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. - The National Cell Repository for Alzheimer&aposs Disease (NCRAD) is a national resource that helps researchers find genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer&aposs by providing biological samples and data. Volunteers are critical to Alzheimer&aposs disease genetics research. The more genetic information that researchers can gather and analyze from individuals and families-both healthy volunteers and those who may be at risk-the more clues they will have for finding additional risk-factor genes.

Each person receives two alleles of a gene, one from each biological parent. This combination is one factor among many that influence a variety of processes in the body. On chromosome 19, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has three common alleles: epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4. - Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene-A gene on chromosome 19 involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. The APOE epsilon4 allele is the major known risk-factor gene for late-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. - Chromosome-A compact structure containing DNA and proteins present in nearly all cells of the body. Chromosomes carry genes, which direct the cell to make proteins and direct a cell&aposs construction, operation, and repair. Normally, each cell has 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Each biological parent contributes one of each pair of chromosomes. - DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)-The hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Almost all cells in a person&aposs body have the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus. - Gene-A basic unit of heredity. Genes direct a cell to make proteins and guide almost every aspect of a cell&aposs construction, operation, and repair. - Genetic mutation-A permanent change in a gene that can be passed on to children. The rare, early-onset familial form of Alzheimer&aposs disease is associated with mutations in genes on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. - Genetic risk factor-A change in a gene that increases a person&aposs risk of developing a disease. - Genetic variant-A change in a gene that may increase or decrease a person&aposs risk of developing a disease or condition. - Genome-An organism&aposs complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain that organism. - Genome-wide association study (GWAS)-A study approach that involves rapidly scanning the genomes of many individuals to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease. - Protein-A substance that determines the physical and chemical characteristics of a cell and therefore of an organism. Proteins are essential to all cell functions and are created using genetic information.

Ovarian cancer (Inheritance): Most cases of ovarian cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. However, approximately 10-25% of ovarian cancer is thought to be inherited . In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known. However, many of these cases are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [1] This means that a person only needs a change ( mutation ) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell to have a hereditary predisposition to ovarian cancer and other cancers associated with these syndromes. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new ( de novo) mutations in the gene. A person with one of these syndromes has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?): Polycystic (pah-lee-SIS-tik) ovary syndrome (PCOS), also known as polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common health problem caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones. The hormonal imbalance creates problems in the ovaries. The ovaries make the egg that is released each month as part of a healthy menstrual cycle. With PCOS, the egg may not develop as it should or it may not be released during ovulation as it should be. PCOS can cause missed or irregular menstrual periods. Irregular periods can lead to:

It&aposs it possible for this post of his brain to grown to normal and he grow out of it?	Polymicrogyria: Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth. Specifically, the surface of the brain develops too many folds which are unusually small. The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ); delayed development; crossed eyes ; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome . Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] A wide variety of symptoms may be observed in people with polymicrogyria, depending on the areas of the brain implicated and whether or not it is part of a larger syndrome . Signs and symptoms may include: [3] [4] Developmental delay Crossed eyes Epilepsy Paralysis of the face, throat, and tongue Difficulty with speech and swallowing Drooling The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made by imaging brain structures using  MRI . Typical findings include areas of the  cerebral cortex with a complex set of small gyri that appear fused to each other and separated by shallow sulci. These findings may be isolated to one side of the brain (unilateral) or may involve both sides of the brain (bilateral).

Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria: Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is a rare neurological disorder that affects the cerebral cortex (the outer surface of the brain). [1] [2] [3] This is the most widespread form of polymicrogyria and typically affects the entire surface of the brain. [1] Signs and symptoms include severe  intellectual disability , problems with movement, and  seizures that are difficult or impossible to treat. [1] [2] While the exact cause of bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to improper brain development during embryonic growth. [2] Most cases appear to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.

However, researchers have identified several environmental and genetic factors that can be responsible for the disorder. Environmental causes of polymicrogyria include certain infections during pregnancy and a lack of oxygen to the fetus (intrauterine ischemia). Researchers are investigating the genetic causes of polymicrogyria. The condition can result from deletions or rearrangements of genetic material from several different chromosomes. Additionally, mutations in one gene, ADGRG1, have been found to cause a severe form of the condition called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). The ADGRG1 gene appears to be critical for the normal development of the outer layer of the brain. Researchers believe that many other genes are probably involved in the different forms of polymicrogyria.

Preeclampsia (Prevention): There is no known way to prevent preeclampsia. It is important for all pregnant women to start prenatal care early and continue it through the pregnancy.
0.777777777778	prevention of preeclampsia I know that the jury is out on the exact causes of preeclampsia, but I am looking for some of the ways that the chances of acquiring it can be minimized.	Preeclampsia and Eclampsia (How many women are affected by or at risk of preeclampsia?): The exact number of women who develop preeclampsia is not known. Some estimates suggest that preeclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies globally and about 3.4% in the United States.1,2The condition is estimated to account for 10% to 15% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 Disorders related to high blood pressure are the second leading cause of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths in developing nations.3In addition, HELLP syndrome occurs in about 10% to 20% of all women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.4Although preeclampsia occurs primarily in first pregnancies, a woman who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is seven times more likely to develop preeclampsia in a later pregnancy.5Other factors that can increase a woman&aposs risk include:5- Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy - High blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy - Obesity. Overweight or obese women are also more likely to have preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy.6 - Age. Women older than 40 are at higher risk. - Multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one fetus) - African American ethnicity. Also, among women who have had preeclampsia before, non-white women are more likely than white women to develop preeclampsia again in a later pregnancy.6 - Family history of preeclampsia. According to the World Health Organization, among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters also will get the disorder.7Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines,8 diabetes,9 rheumatoid arthritis,10 lupus,11 scleroderma,12 urinary tract infections,13 gum disease,14 polycystic ovary syndrome,15 multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.16Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or in vitro fertilization.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia.17 Women who are pregnant or who are thinking about getting pregnant should talk with their health care provider about preeclampsia risk and ways to reduce the risk.

Preeclampsia (Causes): The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta - the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta. In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don&apost seem to develop or function properly. They&aposre narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them. Causes of this abnormal development may include: - Insufficient blood flow to the uterus - Damage to the blood vessels - A problem with the immune system - Certain genes Preeclampsia is classified as one of four high blood pressure disorders that can occur during pregnancy. The other three are: - Gestational hypertension. Women with gestational hypertension have high blood pressure but no excess protein in their urine or other signs of organ damage. Some women with gestational hypertension eventually develop preeclampsia. - Chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy. But because high blood pressure usually doesn&apost have symptoms, it may be hard to determine when it began. - Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This condition occurs in women who have been diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, but then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy.
0.444444444444	prevention of preeclampsia I know that the jury is out on the exact causes of preeclampsia, but I am looking for some of the ways that the chances of acquiring it can be minimized.	Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. Even a slight rise in blood pressure may be a sign of preeclampsia. Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious - even fatal - complications for both you and your baby. If you have preeclampsia, the only cure is delivery of your baby. If you&aposre diagnosed with preeclampsia too early in your pregnancy to deliver your baby, you and your doctor face a challenging task. Your baby needs more time to mature, but you need to avoid putting yourself or your baby at risk of serious complications. Preeclampsia sometimes develops without any symptoms. High blood pressure may develop slowly, or it may have a sudden onset. Monitoring your blood pressure is an important part of prenatal care because the first sign of preeclampsia is commonly a rise in blood pressure. Blood pressure that exceeds 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or greater - documented on two occasions, at least four hours apart - is abnormal. Other signs and symptoms of preeclampsia may include: - Excess protein in your urine (proteinuria) or additional signs of kidney problems - Severe headaches - Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity - Upper abdominal pain, usually under your ribs on the right side - Nausea or vomiting - Decreased urine output - Decreased levels of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia) - Impaired liver function - Shortness of breath, caused by fluid in your lungs Sudden weight gain and swelling (edema) - particularly in your face and hands - may occur with preeclampsia. But these also occur in many normal pregnancies, so they&aposre not considered reliable signs of preeclampsia. Make sure you attend your prenatal visits so that your care provider can monitor your blood pressure. Contact your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room if you have severe headaches, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, severe pain in your abdomen, or severe shortness of breath. Because headaches, nausea, and aches and pains are common pregnancy complaints, it&aposs difficult to know when new symptoms are simply part of being pregnant and when they may indicate a serious problem - especially if it&aposs your first pregnancy. If you&aposre concerned about your symptoms, contact your doctor. The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta - the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta. In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don&apost seem to develop or function properly. They&aposre narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them.

Some women with gestational hypertension eventually develop preeclampsia. - Chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy. But because high blood pressure usually doesn&apost have symptoms, it may be hard to determine when it began. - Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This condition occurs in women who have been diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, but then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy. Preeclampsia develops only as a complication of pregnancy. Risk factors include: - History of preeclampsia. A personal or family history of preeclampsia significantly raises your risk of preeclampsia. - Chronic hypertension. If you already have chronic hypertension, you have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia. - First pregnancy. The risk of developing preeclampsia is highest during your first pregnancy. - New paternity. Each pregnancy with a new partner increases the risk of preeclampsia more than does a second or third pregnancy with the same partner. - Age. The risk of preeclampsia is higher for very young pregnant women as well as pregnant women older than 40. - Obesity. The risk of preeclampsia is higher if you&aposre obese. - Multiple pregnancy. Preeclampsia is more common in women who are carrying twins, triplets or other multiples. - Interval between pregnancies. Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia. - History of certain conditions. Having certain conditions before you become pregnant - such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus - increases your risk of preeclampsia. - In vitro fertilization. Your risk of preeclampsia is increased if your baby was conceived with in vitro fertilization. The more severe your preeclampsia and the earlier it occurs in your pregnancy, the greater the risks for you and your baby. Preeclampsia may require induced labor and delivery. Delivery by cesarean delivery (C-section) may be necessary if there are clinical or obstetric conditions that require a speedy delivery. Your obstetric provider will assist you in deciding what type of delivery is correct for your condition. Complications of preeclampsia may include: - Fetal growth restriction. Preeclampsia affects the arteries carrying blood to the placenta. If the placenta doesn&apost get enough blood, your baby may receive inadequate blood and oxygen and fewer nutrients. This can lead to slow growth known as fetal growth restriction, low birth weight or preterm birth. - Preterm birth. If you have preeclampsia with severe features, you may need to be delivered early, to save the life of you and your baby. Prematurity can lead to breathing and other problems for your baby. Your health care provider will help you understand when is the ideal time for your delivery. - Placental abruption. Preeclampsia increases your risk of placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the inner wall of your uterus before delivery. Severe abruption can cause heavy bleeding, which can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. - HELLP syndrome. HELLP - which stands for hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count - syndrome is a more severe form of preeclampsia, and can rapidly become life-threatening for both you and your baby. Symptoms of HELLP syndrome include nausea and vomiting, headache, and upper right abdominal pain. HELLP syndrome is particularly dangerous because it represents damage to several organ systems. On occasion, it may develop suddenly, even before high blood pressure is detected or it may develop without any symptoms at all. - Eclampsia. When preeclampsia isn&apost controlled, eclampsia - which is essentially preeclampsia plus seizures - can develop. It is very difficult to predict which patients will have preeclampsia that is severe enough to result in eclampsia. Often, there are no symptoms or warning signs to predict eclampsia. Because eclampsia can have serious consequences for both mom and baby, delivery becomes necessary, regardless of how far along the pregnancy is. - Other organ damage. Preeclampsia may result in kidney, liver, lung, heart, or eyes, and may cause a stroke or other brain injury. The amount of injury to other organs depends on the severity of preeclampsia. - Cardiovascular disease. Having preeclampsia may increase your risk of future heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The risk is even greater if you&aposve had preeclampsia more than once or you&aposve had a preterm delivery. To minimize this risk, after delivery try to maintain your ideal weight, eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and don&apost smoke. To diagnose preeclampsia, you have to have high blood pressure and one or more of the following complications after the 20th week of pregnancy: - Protein in your urine (proteinuria) - A low platelet count - Impaired liver function - Signs of kidney trouble other than protein in the urine - Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) - New-onset headaches or visual disturbances Previously, preeclampsia was only diagnosed if high blood pressure and protein in the urine were present. However, experts now know that it&aposs possible to have preeclampsia, yet never have protein in the urine. A blood pressure reading in excess of 140/90 mm Hg is abnormal in pregnancy. However, a single high blood pressure reading doesn&apost mean you have preeclampsia. If you have one reading in the abnormal range - or a reading that&aposs substantially higher than your usual blood pressure - your doctor will closely observe your numbers. Having a second abnormal blood pressure reading four hours after the first may confirm your doctor&aposs suspicion of preeclampsia. Your doctor may have you come in for additional blood pressure readings and blood and urine tests. Tests that may be needed If your doctor suspects preeclampsia, you may need certain tests, including: - Blood tests. Your doctor will order liver function tests, kidney function tests and also measure your platelets - the cells that help blood clot. - Urine analysis. Your doctor will ask you to collect your urine for 24 hours, for measurement of the amount of protein in your urine. A single urine sample that measures the ratio of protein to creatinine - a chemical that&aposs always present in the urine - also may be used to make the diagnosis. - Fetal ultrasound. Your doctor may also recommend close monitoring of your baby&aposs growth, typically through ultrasound. The images of your baby created during the ultrasound exam allow your doctor to estimate fetal weight and the amount of fluid in the uterus (amniotic fluid). - Nonstress test or biophysical profile. A nonstress test is a simple procedure that checks how your baby&aposs heart rate reacts when your baby moves. A biophysical profile uses an ultrasound to measure your baby&aposs breathing, muscle tone, movement and the volume of amniotic fluid in your uterus. The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. You&aposre at increased risk of seizures, placental abruption, stroke and possibly severe bleeding until your blood pressure decreases. Of course, if it&aposs too early in your pregnancy, delivery may not be the best thing for your baby. If you&aposre diagnosed with preeclampsia, your doctor will let you know how often you&aposll need to come in for prenatal visits - likely more frequently than what&aposs typically recommended for pregnancy. You&aposll also need more frequent blood tests, ultrasounds and nonstress tests than would be expected in an uncomplicated pregnancy. Medications Possible treatment for preeclampsia may include: - Medications to lower blood pressure. These medications, called antihypertensives, are used to lower your blood pressure if it&aposs dangerously high. Blood pressure in the 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range generally isn&apost treated. Although there are many different types of antihypertensive medications, a number of them aren&apost safe to use during pregnancy. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to use an antihypertensive medicine in your situation to control your blood pressure. - Corticosteroids. If you have severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, corticosteroid medications can temporarily improve liver and platelet function to help prolong your pregnancy. Corticosteroids can also help your baby&aposs lungs become more mature in as little as 48 hours - an important step in preparing a premature baby for life outside the womb. - Anticonvulsant medications. If your preeclampsia is severe, your doctor may prescribe an anticonvulsant medication, such as magnesium sulfate, to prevent a first seizure. Bed rest Bed rest used to be routinely recommended for women with preeclampsia. But research hasn&apost shown a benefit from this practice, and it can increase your risk of blood clots, as well as impact your economic and social lives. For most women, bed rest is no longer recommended. Hospitalization Severe preeclampsia may require that you be hospitalized. In the hospital, your doctor may perform regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles to monitor your baby&aposs well-being and measure the volume of amniotic fluid. A lack of amniotic fluid is a sign of poor blood supply to the baby. Delivery If you&aposre diagnosed with preeclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend inducing labor right away. The readiness of your cervix - whether it&aposs beginning to open (dilate), thin (efface) and soften (ripen) - also may be a factor in determining whether or when labor will be induced. In severe cases, it may not be possible to consider your baby&aposs gestational age or the readiness of your cervix. If it&aposs not possible to wait, your doctor may induce labor or schedule a C-section right away. During delivery, you may be given magnesium sulfate intravenously to prevent seizures. If you need pain-relieving medication after your delivery, ask your doctor what you should take. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve), can increase your blood pressure.

The risk of preeclampsia is higher for very young pregnant women as well as pregnant women older than 40. - Obesity. The risk of preeclampsia is higher if you&aposre obese. - Multiple pregnancy. Preeclampsia is more common in women who are carrying twins, triplets or other multiples. - Interval between pregnancies. Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia. - History of certain conditions. Having certain conditions before you become pregnant - such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus - increases your risk of preeclampsia. - In vitro fertilization. Your risk of preeclampsia is increased if your baby was conceived with in vitro fertilization.

Preeclampsia (Complications): The more severe your preeclampsia and the earlier it occurs in your pregnancy, the greater the risks for you and your baby. Preeclampsia may require induced labor and delivery. Delivery by cesarean delivery (C-section) may be necessary if there are clinical or obstetric conditions that require a speedy delivery. Your obstetric provider will assist you in deciding what type of delivery is correct for your condition. Complications of preeclampsia may include: - Fetal growth restriction. Preeclampsia affects the arteries carrying blood to the placenta. If the placenta doesn&apost get enough blood, your baby may receive inadequate blood and oxygen and fewer nutrients. This can lead to slow growth known as fetal growth restriction, low birth weight or preterm birth. - Preterm birth. If you have preeclampsia with severe features, you may need to be delivered early, to save the life of you and your baby. Prematurity can lead to breathing and other problems for your baby. Your health care provider will help you understand when is the ideal time for your delivery. - Placental abruption. Preeclampsia increases your risk of placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the inner wall of your uterus before delivery. Severe abruption can cause heavy bleeding, which can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. - HELLP syndrome. HELLP - which stands for hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count - syndrome is a more severe form of preeclampsia, and can rapidly become life-threatening for both you and your baby. Symptoms of HELLP syndrome include nausea and vomiting, headache, and upper right abdominal pain. HELLP syndrome is particularly dangerous because it represents damage to several organ systems. On occasion, it may develop suddenly, even before high blood pressure is detected or it may develop without any symptoms at all. - Eclampsia. When preeclampsia isn&apost controlled, eclampsia - which is essentially preeclampsia plus seizures - can develop. It is very difficult to predict which patients will have preeclampsia that is severe enough to result in eclampsia. Often, there are no symptoms or warning signs to predict eclampsia. Because eclampsia can have serious consequences for both mom and baby, delivery becomes necessary, regardless of how far along the pregnancy is. - Other organ damage. Preeclampsia may result in kidney, liver, lung, heart, or eyes, and may cause a stroke or other brain injury. The amount of injury to other organs depends on the severity of preeclampsia. - Cardiovascular disease. Having preeclampsia may increase your risk of future heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The risk is even greater if you&aposve had preeclampsia more than once or you&aposve had a preterm delivery. To minimize this risk, after delivery try to maintain your ideal weight, eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and don&apost smoke.

Preeclampsia (Treatment): The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. You&aposre at increased risk of seizures, placental abruption, stroke and possibly severe bleeding until your blood pressure decreases. Of course, if it&aposs too early in your pregnancy, delivery may not be the best thing for your baby. If you&aposre diagnosed with preeclampsia, your doctor will let you know how often you&aposll need to come in for prenatal visits - likely more frequently than what&aposs typically recommended for pregnancy. You&aposll also need more frequent blood tests, ultrasounds and nonstress tests than would be expected in an uncomplicated pregnancy. Medications Possible treatment for preeclampsia may include: - Medications to lower blood pressure. These medications, called antihypertensives, are used to lower your blood pressure if it&aposs dangerously high. Blood pressure in the 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range generally isn&apost treated. Although there are many different types of antihypertensive medications, a number of them aren&apost safe to use during pregnancy. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to use an antihypertensive medicine in your situation to control your blood pressure. - Corticosteroids. If you have severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, corticosteroid medications can temporarily improve liver and platelet function to help prolong your pregnancy. Corticosteroids can also help your baby&aposs lungs become more mature in as little as 48 hours - an important step in preparing a premature baby for life outside the womb. - Anticonvulsant medications. If your preeclampsia is severe, your doctor may prescribe an anticonvulsant medication, such as magnesium sulfate, to prevent a first seizure. Bed rest Bed rest used to be routinely recommended for women with preeclampsia. But research hasn&apost shown a benefit from this practice, and it can increase your risk of blood clots, as well as impact your economic and social lives. For most women, bed rest is no longer recommended. Hospitalization Severe preeclampsia may require that you be hospitalized. In the hospital, your doctor may perform regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles to monitor your baby&aposs well-being and measure the volume of amniotic fluid. A lack of amniotic fluid is a sign of poor blood supply to the baby. Delivery If you&aposre diagnosed with preeclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend inducing labor right away. The readiness of your cervix - whether it&aposs beginning to open (dilate), thin (efface) and soften (ripen) - also may be a factor in determining whether or when labor will be induced. In severe cases, it may not be possible to consider your baby&aposs gestational age or the readiness of your cervix. If it&aposs not possible to wait, your doctor may induce labor or schedule a C-section right away. During delivery, you may be given magnesium sulfate intravenously to prevent seizures. If you need pain-relieving medication after your delivery, ask your doctor what you should take. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve), can increase your blood pressure.
0.333333333333	prevention of preeclampsia I know that the jury is out on the exact causes of preeclampsia, but I am looking for some of the ways that the chances of acquiring it can be minimized.	Preeclampsia and Eclampsia: Preeclampsia (pree-i-KLAMP-see-uh) and eclampsia (ih-KLAMP-see-uh) are pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. In preeclampsia, the mother’s high blood pressure reduces the blood supply to the fetus, which may get less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Eclampsia is when pregnant women with preeclampsia develop seizures or coma. NICHD and other agencies are working to understand what causes these conditions and how they can be prevented and better treated. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are part of the spectrum of high blood pressure, or hypertensive, disorders that can occur during pregnancy.At the mild end of the spectrum is gestational hypertension, which occurs when a woman who previously had normal blood pressure develops high blood pressure when she is more than 20 weeks pregnant and her blood pressure returns to normal within 12 weeks after delivery. This problem usually occurs without other symptoms. In many cases, gestational hypertension does not harm the mother or fetus. Severe gestational hypertension, however, may be associated with preterm birth and infants who are small for their age at birth.1 And about 15% to 25% of women with gestational hypertension go on to develop preeclampsia.2Preeclampsia is similar to gestational hypertension, because it also describes high blood pressure at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman whose blood pressure was normal before pregnancy. But preeclampsia can also include blood pressure at or greater than 140/90 mmHg, increased swelling, and protein in the urine.3 The condition can be serious and is a leading cause of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy).4 If it is severe enough to affect brain function, causing seizures or coma, it is called eclampsia.One of the serious complications of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy is HELLP syndrome, a situation in which a pregnant woman with preeclampsia or eclampsia suffers damage to the liver and blood cells. The letters in the name HELLP stand for the following problems:- H - Hemolysis, in which oxygen-carrying red blood cells break down - EL - Elevated Liver enzymes, showing damage to the liver - LP - Low Platelet count, meaning that the cells responsible for stopping bleeding are low The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not known. These disorders previously were believed to be caused by a toxin, called “toxemia,” in the blood, but health care providers now know that is not true. Nevertheless, preeclampsia is sometimes still referred to as “toxemia.”To learn more about preeclampsia and eclampsia, scientists are investigating many factors that could contribute to the development and progression of these diseases, including:- Placental abnormalities, such as insufficient blood flow - Genetic factors - Environmental exposures - Nutritional factors - Maternal immunology and autoimmune disorders - Cardiovascular and inflammatory changes - Hormonal imbalances - Risks During Pregnancy Preeclampsia during pregnancy is mild in 75% of cases.1 However, a woman can progress from mild to severe preeclampsia or to full eclampsia very quickly―even in a matter of days. Both preeclampsia and eclampsia can cause serious health problems for the mother and infant. Women with preeclampsia are at increased risk for damage to the kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems. Preeclampsia may also affect the placenta. The condition could lead to a separation of the placenta from the uterus (referred to as placental abruption), preterm birth, and pregnancy loss or stillbirth. In some cases, preeclampsia can lead to organ failure or stroke. In severe cases, preeclampsia can develop into eclampsia, which includes seizures. Seizures in eclampsia may cause a woman to lose consciousness and twitch uncontrollably.2 If the fetus is not delivered, these conditions can cause the death of the mother and/or the fetus. Expecting mothers rarely die from preeclampsia in the developed world, but it is still a major cause of illness and death globally.3 According to the World Health Organization, preeclampsia and eclampsia cause 14% of maternal deaths each year, or about 50,000 to 75,000 women worldwide.4 - Risks After Pregnancy In “uncomplicated preeclampsia,” the mother’s high blood pressure and other symptoms usually go back to normal within 6 weeks of the infant’s birth. However, studies have shown that women who had preeclampsia are four times more likely to later develop hypertension (high blood pressure) and are twice as likely to later develop ischemic heart disease (reduced blood supply to the heart muscle, which can cause heart attacks), a blood clot in a vein, and stroke as are women who did not have preeclampsia.5 Less commonly, mothers who had preeclampsia could experience permanent damage to their organs, such as their kidneys and liver. They could also experience fluid in the lungs. In the days following birth, women with preeclampsia remain at increased risk for developing eclampsia and seizures.3,6 Preeclampsia may be related to problems with the placenta early in the pregnancy.1 Such problems pose risks to the fetus, including:- Lack of oxygen and nutrients, which can impair fetal growth - Preterm birth - Stillbirth if placental abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterine wall) leads to heavy bleeding in the mother - Death: According to the Preeclampsia Foundation , each year, about 10,500 infants in the United States and about half a million worldwide die due to preeclampsia.2 Stillbirths are more likely to occur when the mother has a more severe form of preeclampsia, including HELLP syndrome.Infants whose mothers had preeclampsia are also at increased risk for later problems, even if they were born at full term (39 weeks of pregnancy).3 Infants born preterm due to preeclampsia face a higher risk of some long-term health issues, mostly related to being born early, including learning disorders, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, deafness, and blindness. Infants born preterm may also have to be hospitalized for a long time after birth and may be smaller than infants born full term. Infants who experienced poor growth in the uterus may later be at higher risk of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure.4 The exact number of women who develop preeclampsia is not known. Some estimates suggest that preeclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies globally and about 3.4% in the United States.1,2The condition is estimated to account for 10% to 15% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 Disorders related to high blood pressure are the second leading cause of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths in developing nations.3In addition, HELLP syndrome occurs in about 10% to 20% of all women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.4Although preeclampsia occurs primarily in first pregnancies, a woman who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is seven times more likely to develop preeclampsia in a later pregnancy.5Other factors that can increase a woman&aposs risk include:5- Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy - High blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy - Obesity. Overweight or obese women are also more likely to have preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy.6 - Age. Women older than 40 are at higher risk. - Multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one fetus) - African American ethnicity. Also, among women who have had preeclampsia before, non-white women are more likely than white women to develop preeclampsia again in a later pregnancy.6 - Family history of preeclampsia. According to the World Health Organization, among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters also will get the disorder.7Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines,8 diabetes,9 rheumatoid arthritis,10 lupus,11 scleroderma,12 urinary tract infections,13 gum disease,14 polycystic ovary syndrome,15 multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.16Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or in vitro fertilization.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia.17 Women who are pregnant or who are thinking about getting pregnant should talk with their health care provider about preeclampsia risk and ways to reduce the risk. - Preeclampsia Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include: - High blood pressure - Too much protein in the urine - Swelling in a woman&aposs face and hands (a woman&aposs feet might swell too, but swollen feet are common during pregnancy and may not signal a problem) - Systemic problems, such as headache, blurred vision, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain - High blood pressure - Too much protein in the urine - Swelling in a woman&aposs face and hands (a woman&aposs feet might swell too, but swollen feet are common during pregnancy and may not signal a problem) - Systemic problems, such as headache, blurred vision, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain - Eclampsia The following symptoms are cause for immediate concern:1 - Seizures - Severe headache - Vision problems, such as temporary blindness - Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right area of the belly - Nausea and vomiting - Smaller urine output or not urinating very often - Seizures - Severe headache - Vision problems, such as temporary blindness - Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right area of the belly - Nausea and vomiting - Smaller urine output or not urinating very often - HELLP Syndrome HELLP syndrome can lead to serious complications, including liver failure and death.1 A pregnant woman with HELLP syndrome might bleed or bruise easily and/or experience abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, headache, or extreme fatigue. Although most women who develop HELLP syndrome already have high blood pressure and preeclampsia, sometimes the syndrome is the first sign. In addition, HELLP syndrome can occur without a woman having either high blood pressure or protein in her urine. A health care provider will check a pregnant woman’s blood pressure and urine during each prenatal visit. If the blood pressure reading is considered high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, the health care provider will likely perform blood tests and more extensive lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine (called proteinuria) as well as other symptoms.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists provides the following criteria for a diagnosis of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome.Gestational hypertension is diagnosed if a pregnant woman has high blood pressure but no protein in the urine. Gestational hypertension occurs when women whose blood pressure levels were normal before pregnancy develop high blood pressure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Gestational hypertension can progress into preeclampsia.1Mild preeclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman has:2- Systolic blood pressure (top number) of 140 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) of 90 mmHg or higher and either - Urine with 0.3 or more grams of protein in a 24-hour specimen (a collection of every drop of urine within 24 hours) or a protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 0.3  or - Blood tests that show kidney or liver dysfunction - Fluid in the lungs and difficulty breathing - Visual impairmentsSevere preeclampsia occurs when a pregnant woman has any of the following:- Systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or higher on two occasions at least 4 hours apart while the patient is on bed rest - Urine with 5 or more grams of protein in a 24-hour specimen or 3 or more grams of protein on 2 random urine samples collected at least 4 hours apart - Test results suggesting kidney or liver damage—for example, blood tests that reveal low numbers of platelets or high liver enzymes - Severe, unexplained stomach pain that does not respond to medication - Symptoms that include visual disturbances, difficulty breathing, or fluid buildup3Eclampsia occurs when women with preeclampsia develop seizures. The seizures can happen before or during labor or after the baby is delivered. HELLP syndrome is diagnosed when laboratory tests show hemolysis (burst red blood cells release hemoglobin into the blood plasma), elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. There also may or may not be extra protein in the urine.4Some women may also be diagnosed with superimposed preeclampsia—a situation in which the woman develops preeclampsia on top of high blood pressure that was present before she got pregnant. Health care providers look for an increase in blood pressure and either protein in the urine, fluid buildup, or both for a diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia.In addition to tests that might diagnose preeclampsia or similar problems, health care providers may do other tests to assess the health of the mother and fetus, including:- Blood tests to see how well the mother&aposs liver and kidneys are working - Blood tests to check blood platelet levels to see how well the mother’s blood is clotting - Blood tests to count the total number of red blood cells in the mother’s blood - A maternal weight check - An ultrasound to assess the fetus’s size - A check of the fetus&aposs heart rate - A physical exam to look for swelling in the mother’s face, hands, or legs as well as abdominal tenderness or an enlarged liver - Preeclampsia Treatment If the pregnancy is at 37 weeks or later, the health care provider will usually want to deliver the fetus to treat preeclampsia and avoid further complications. If the pregnancy is at less than 37 weeks, however, the woman and her health care provider may consider treatment options that give the fetus more time to develop, depending on how severe the condition is. A health care provider may consider the following options: - If the preeclampsia is mild, it may be possible to wait to deliver. To help prevent further complications, the health care provider may ask the woman to go on bed rest to try to lower blood pressure and increase the blood flow to the placenta. - Close monitoring of the woman and her fetus will be needed. Tests for the mother might include blood and urine tests to see if the preeclampsia is progressing, such as tests to assess platelet counts, liver enzymes, kidney function, and urinary protein levels. Tests for the fetus might include ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, assessment of fetal growth, and amniotic fluid assessment. - Anticonvulsive medication, such as magnesium sulfate, might be used to prevent a seizure. - In some cases, such as with severe preeclampsia, the woman will be admitted to the hospital so she can be monitored closely and continuously. Treatment in the hospital might include intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus&aposs lungs. When a woman has severe preeclampsia and is at 34 weeks of pregnancy or later, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends delivery as soon as medically possible. If the pregnancy is at less than 34 weeks, health care providers will probably prescribe corticosteroids to help speed up the maturation of the fetal lungs before attempting delivery.2 Preterm delivery may be necessary, even if that means likely complications for the infant, because of the risk of severe maternal complications. The symptoms of preeclampsia usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery.3 - If the preeclampsia is mild, it may be possible to wait to deliver. To help prevent further complications, the health care provider may ask the woman to go on bed rest to try to lower blood pressure and increase the blood flow to the placenta. - Close monitoring of the woman and her fetus will be needed. Tests for the mother might include blood and urine tests to see if the preeclampsia is progressing, such as tests to assess platelet counts, liver enzymes, kidney function, and urinary protein levels. Tests for the fetus might include ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, assessment of fetal growth, and amniotic fluid assessment. - Anticonvulsive medication, such as magnesium sulfate, might be used to prevent a seizure. - In some cases, such as with severe preeclampsia, the woman will be admitted to the hospital so she can be monitored closely and continuously. Treatment in the hospital might include intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus&aposs lungs. - Eclampsia Treatment Eclampsia—the onset of seizures in a woman with preeclampsia—is considered a medical emergency. Immediate treatment, usually in a hospital, is needed to stop the mother&aposs seizures, treat blood pressure levels that are too high, and deliver the fetus. Magnesium sulfate (a type of mineral) may be given to treat active seizures and prevent future seizures. Antihypertensive medications may be given to lower the blood pressure. - HELLP Syndrome Treatment HELLP syndrome, a severe complication of preeclampsia and eclampsia, can lead to serious complications for the mother, including liver failure and death, as well as the fetus. The health care provider may consider the following treatments after a diagnosis of HELLP syndrome: - Delivery of the fetus - Hospitalization to provide intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus&aposs lungs.4 - Delivery of the fetus - Hospitalization to provide intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus&aposs lungs.4 - If I have high blood pressure, can I take steps to prevent problems like preeclampsia during pregnancy? If you currently have chronic hypertension (high blood pressure not due to pregnancy), you may be at higher-than-average risk for getting preeclampsia during pregnancy. Your risk is also higher if you had gestational hypertension (high blood pressure that occurs only during pregnancy) or preeclampsia with a previous pregnancy, if you are obese, or if you have other risk factors.1 Talk with your health care provider about how hypertension might affect your pregnancy and what you can do to lower your risk. Before You Get Pregnant - Visit your health care provider for a preconception visit to discuss what you can do to lower your risk. Your health care provider may recommend ways to control your blood pressure, if needed, by limiting your salt intake, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you are overweight. - If you take medication to control your blood pressure, ask your health care provider if you should change it. Some medications should not be used during pregnancy. Your health care provider may be able to recommend safer alternatives. While You Are Pregnant - Get regular prenatal care, including regular blood pressure checks, urine tests for protein, as well as regular weight checks. - Avoid alcohol and tobacco. - Talk with your health care provider about any drugs or supplements that you take or are thinking of taking, including vitamins and herbs. Follow your provider&aposs recommendations about prescription and other medications. - If you are at very high risk of preeclampsia, your doctor may recommend that you start taking low-dose aspirin after at least 12 weeks of pregnancy.2 [top] - Visit your health care provider for a preconception visit to discuss what you can do to lower your risk.

If you had preeclampsia during your first pregnancy, your risk of developing preeclampsia again is about 15%.3 Your risk is even higher if you delivered your first child before 28 weeks of pregnancy or if you are overweight or obese.3 Your risk of having preeclampsia again is also higher if you developed preeclampsia early in your previous pregnancy, if you developed chronic hypertension or diabetes after the first pregnancy, if you had in vitro fertilization, or if you are carrying more than one fetus. Having severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome during the first pregnancy also raises your risk. If you had HELLP syndrome during a pregnancy, you have about a 20% chance of getting some form of gestational hypertension again.4 [top]
-0.888888888889	prevention of preeclampsia I know that the jury is out on the exact causes of preeclampsia, but I am looking for some of the ways that the chances of acquiring it can be minimized.	Postpartum preeclampsia: Postpartum preeclampsia is a rare condition that occurs when a woman has high blood pressure and excess protein in her urine soon after childbirth. Most cases of postpartum preeclampsia develop within 48 hours of childbirth. However, postpartum preeclampsia sometimes develops up to six weeks after childbirth. This is known as late postpartum preeclampsia. Postpartum preeclampsia requires prompt treatment. Left untreated, postpartum preeclampsia can result in seizures and other serious complications. Preeclampsia is a similar condition that develops during pregnancy and typically resolves with the birth of the baby. Postpartum preeclampsia can be difficult to detect on your own. Many women who experience postpartum preeclampsia show no signs or symptoms during pregnancy. Also, you might not suspect that anything is wrong when you&aposre focused on recovering after childbirth and caring for a newborn. Signs and symptoms of postpartum preeclampsia - which are typically similar to those of preeclampsia that occurs during pregnancy - might include: - High blood pressure (hypertension) - 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or greater - Excess protein in your urine (proteinuria) - Severe headaches - Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity - Swelling of the face and limbs - Upper abdominal pain, usually under the ribs on the right side - Nausea or vomiting - Decreased urination - Sudden weight gain, typically more than 2 pounds (0.9 kilogram) a week If you have signs or symptoms of postpartum preeclampsia shortly after childbirth, contact your health care provider right away. Depending on the circumstances, you might need immediate medical care. The causes of postpartum preeclampsia and preeclampsia that occurs during pregnancy aren&apost well-understood. While preeclampsia is typically cured by childbirth, it&aposs believed that postpartum preeclampsia is set into motion during pregnancy but doesn&apost cause symptoms until after delivery. Limited research suggests that risk factors for postpartum preeclampsia might include: - High blood pressure during your most recent pregnancy (hypertensive disease). You&aposre at increased risk of postpartum preeclampsia if you developed high blood pressure after 20 weeks of pregnancy (gestational hypertension). - Obesity. The risk of postpartum preeclampsia is higher if you&aposre obese. - Family history. Having a first-degree relative - a parent or sibling - with a history of preeclampsia increases your risk of preeclampsia. - Age. Women who are younger than 20 or older than 40 are at increased risk of preeclampsia. - Having multiples. Having twins or more babies increases your risk of preeclampsia. Recent studies suggest that the father&aposs genes may play a role in an increased risk of preeclampsia. Complications of postpartum preeclampsia include: - Postpartum eclampsia. Postpartum eclampsia is essentially postpartum preeclampsia plus seizures. Postpartum eclampsia can permanently damage vital organs, including your brain, liver and kidneys. Left untreated, postpartum eclampsia can cause coma. In some cases, the condition is fatal. - Pulmonary edema. This life-threatening lung condition occurs when excess fluid develops in the lungs. - Stroke. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and food. A stroke is a medical emergency. - Thromboembolism. Thromboembolism is the blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot that travels from another part of the body. This condition is also a medical emergency. - HELLP syndrome. HELLP syndrome - which stands for hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count - can be life-threatening. As with preeclampsia, postpartum preeclampsia might also increase your risk of future cardiovascular disease. If you&aposve already been discharged from the hospital after childbirth and your health care provider suspects that you have postpartum preeclampsia, you might need to be readmitted to the hospital. Postpartum preeclampsia is usually diagnosed with lab tests: - Blood tests. These tests can determine how well your liver and kidneys are functioning and whether your blood has a normal number of platelets - the cells that help blood clot. - Urinalysis. Your health care provider might test a sample of your urine to see if it contains protein. Postpartum preeclampsia may be treated with medication, including: - Medication to lower high blood pressure. If your blood pressure is dangerously high, your health care provider might prescribe a medication to lower your blood pressure (antihypertensive medication). - Medication to prevent seizures. An anticonvulsive medication, such as magnesium sulfate, can help prevent seizures. Magnesium sulfate is typically taken for 24 hours. After treatment with magnesium sulfate, your health care provider will closely monitor your blood pressure, urination and other symptoms. If you&aposre breast-feeding, it&aposs generally considered safe to breast-feed while taking these medications. Ask your health care provider if you have any questions or you&aposre not sure.

Can you tell if you have leukemia?8. What treatments do you need to take?9. What are the signs of leukemia?10. What is the difference between AML and CML ?	Leukemia (Treatment): Treatment for your leukemia depends on many factors. Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system. Common treatments used to fight leukemia include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein. - Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells. - Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body. You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant. - Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow. You may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases you may be able to use your own stem cells. A stem cell transplant is very similar to a bone marrow transplant.

Carry hand sanitizer for times when you cannot wash. - Take care of your mouth. Brush your teeth often with a soft toothbrush and use a mouth rinse that does not contain alcohol. - Stay away from sick people. It is easy to catch a cold, the flu, chicken pox, or other infection from someone who has it. You should also avoid anyone who has had a live vaccine. - Clean yourself carefully after bowel movements. Use baby wipes or water instead of toilet paper and let your doctor know if you have any bleeding or hemorrhoids. - Make sure your food and drinks are safe. DO NOT eat fish, eggs, or meat that is raw or undercooked. And DO NOT eat anything that is spoiled or past the freshness date. - Ask someone else to clean up after pets. DO NOT pick up pet waste or clean fish tanks or birdcages. - Carry sanitizing wipes. Use them before touching public surfaces such as doorknobs, ATM machines, and railings. - Guard against cuts. Use an electric razor to avoid nicking yourself while shaving and do not tear at nail cuticles. Also be careful when using knives, needles, and scissors. If you do get a cut, clean it right away with soap, warm water, and an antiseptic. Clean your cut this way every day until it forms a scab. - Use gloves when gardening. There are often bacteria in soil. - Stay away from crowds. Plan your outings and errands for times that are less crowded. Wear a mask when you have to be around lots of people. - Be gentle with your skin. Use a towel to gently pat dry your skin after a shower or bath, and use lotion to keep it soft. DO NOT pick at pimples or other spots on your skin. - Ask about getting a flu shot. DO NOT get any vaccines without first talking to your provider. You should NOT receive any vaccines that contain a live virus. - Skip the nail salon and care for your nails at home. Make sure you use tools that have been cleaned well.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (Treatment): Medicines that target the abnormal protein made by the Philadelphia chromosome are often the first treatment for CML. These medicines can be taken as pills. Sometimes, chemotherapy is used first to reduce the white blood cell count if it is very high at diagnosis. The blast crisis phase is very difficult to treat. This is because there is a very high count of immature white blood cells (leukemia cells). The only known cure for CML is a bone marrow transplant, or stem cell transplant. Most people, though, do not need a transplant because the targeted medicines are successful. Discuss your options with your oncologist. You and your health care provider may need to manage many other issues or concerns during your leukemia treatment, including: - Managing your pets during chemotherapy - Bleeding problems - Eating enough calories when you are sick - Swelling and pain in your mouth - Safe eating during cancer treatment

Psoriasis (What are the types?): There are several different types of psoriasis. Here are a few examples: - Plaque psoriasis, which causes patches of skin that are red at the base and covered by silvery scales. - Guttate psoriasis, which causes small, drop-shaped lesions on your trunk, limbs, and scalp. This type of psoriasis is most often triggered by upper respiratory infections, such as strep throat. - Pustular psoriasis, which causes pus-filled blisters. Attacks or flares can be caused by medications, infections, stress, or certain chemicals. - Inverse psoriasis, which causes smooth, red patches in folds of skin near the genitals, under the breasts or in the armpits. Rubbing and sweating can make this type of psoriasis worse. - Erythrodermic psoriasis, which causes red and scaly skin over much of your body. This can be a reaction to a bad sunburn or taking certain medications, such as corticosteroids. It can also happen if you have a different type of psoriasis that is not well controlled. This type of psoriasis can be very serious, so if you have it, you should see a doctor immediately. There are several different types of psoriasis.

How to diagnose Psoriasis?: In most cases, your primary care doctor can diagnose psoriasis simply by examining your skin. If your doctor isn&apost sure if you have psoriasis, he or she may order a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of skin and looking at it under a microscope.
1.90909090909	Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.	Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness and irritation. Most people with psoriasis have thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales. Psoriasis is very common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 15 to 35. Psoriasis isn&apost contagious. This means it doesn&apost spread to other people. Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families. Health care providers think it may be an autoimmune condition. This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and inflames or destroys healthy body tissue. Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, this process takes place in 2 weeks rather than in 3 to 4 weeks. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin&aposs surface, forming the patches of scales. The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat: - Infections from bacteria or viruses, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections - Dry air or dry skin - Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites - Some medicines, including antimalaria drugs, beta-blockers, and lithium - Stress - Too little sunlight - Too much sunlight (sunburn) - Drinking too much alcohol Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system. This may be due to: - AIDS - Autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis) - Cancer chemotherapy Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis (psoriatic arthritis). Psoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. Many times, it goes away and then comes back. The main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky patches of skin. The medical term for the patches is plaques. Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, and soles of the feet. The skin may be: - Itchy - Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales) - Pink-red in color (like the color of salmon) - Raised and thick Other symptoms may include: - Genital sores in males - Joint pain or aching - Nail changes, including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, dents in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath - Severe dandruff on the scalp There are 5 main types of psoriasis: - Erythrodermic. The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area. - Guttate. Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form seems to be linked to strep infections. - Inverse. Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin. - Plaque. Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis. - Pustular. White pus-filled blisters (pustules) are surrounded by red, irritated skin. Your provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Sometimes, a skin biopsy is done to rule out other possible conditions. If you have joint pain, your provider may order x-rays. The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection. Three treatment options are available: - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments. - Pills or injections that affect the body&aposs immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: - Cortisone creams and ointments - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) - Moisturizers - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system&aposs faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy: - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse. Some people may benefit from a psoriasis support group. The National Psoriasis Foundation is a good resource: www.psoriasis.org. Psoriasis can be a lifelong condition that can be controlled with treatment. It may go away for a long time and then return. With proper treatment, it will not affect your overall health. But be aware that there is a strong link between psoriasis and other health problems, such as heart disease. Call your provider if you have symptoms of psoriasis or if your skin irritation continues despite treatment. Tell your provider if you have joint pain or fever with your psoriasis attacks. If you have symptoms of arthritis, talk to your dermatologist or rheumatologist. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a severe outbreak that covers all or most of your body. There is no known way to prevent psoriasis. Keeping the skin clean and moist and avoiding your psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. Providers recommend daily baths or showers for people with psoriasis. Avoid scrubbing too hard, because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. Updated by: Kevin Berman, MD, PhD, Atlanta Center for Dermatologic Disease, Atlanta, GA.

Psoriasis (Summary): Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales. The skin on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet is most often affected, but other parts of the body can be affected as well. A problem with the immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in the skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because the cells rise too fast. Although symptoms may come and go, for many, psoriasis is a lifelong condition. Infections, stress, dry skin and certain medications may make symptoms worse. Psoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families. Treatments include creams, medications and light therapy. [1] [2]

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, which means that your body’s immune system – which protects you from diseases – starts overacting and causing problems. If you have psoriasis, a type of white blood cells called the T cells become so active that they trigger other immune system responses, including swelling and fast turnover of skin cells. Your skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise slowly to the surface. This is called cell turnover, and it usually takes about a month. If you have psoriasis, though, cell turnover can take only a few days. Your skin cells rise too fast and pile up on the surface, causing your skin to look red and scaly. Some things may cause a flare, meaning your psoriasis becomes worse for a while, including: - Infections. - Stress. - Changes in the weather that dry out your skin. - Certain medicines. - Cuts, scratches or sunburns. Certain genes have been linked to psoriasis, meaning it runs in families.

Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful. Psoriasis is a chronic disease that often comes and goes. The main goal of treatment is to stop the skin cells from growing so quickly. There is no cure for psoriasis, but you can manage symptoms. Lifestyle measures, such as moisturizing, quitting smoking and managing stress, may help. Psoriasis care at Mayo Clinic Psoriasis signs and symptoms are different for everyone. Common signs and symptoms include: - Red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales - Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) - Dry, cracked skin that may bleed - Itching, burning or soreness - Thickened, pitted or ridged nails - Swollen and stiff joints Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into complete remission. There are several types of psoriasis. These include: - Plaque psoriasis. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or painful and there may be few or many. They can occur anywhere on your body, including your genitals and the soft tissue inside your mouth. - Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble. - Guttate psoriasis. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It&aposs usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It&aposs marked by small, water-drop-shaped, scaling lesions on your trunk, arms, legs and scalp. The lesions are covered by a fine scale and aren&apost as thick as typical plaques are. You may have a single outbreak that goes away on its own, or you may have repeated episodes. - Inverse psoriasis. This mainly affects the skin in the armpits, in the groin, under the breasts and around the genitals. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red, inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. - Pustular psoriasis. This uncommon form of psoriasis can occur in widespread patches (generalized pustular psoriasis) or in smaller areas on your hands, feet or fingertips. It generally develops quickly, with pus-filled blisters appearing just hours after your skin becomes red and tender. The blisters may come and go frequently. Generalized pustular psoriasis can also cause fever, chills, severe itching and diarrhea. - Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. - Psoriatic arthritis. In addition to inflamed, scaly skin, psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only manifestation of psoriasis or at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. Although the disease usually isn&apost as crippling as other forms of arthritis, it can cause stiffness and progressive joint damage that in the most serious cases may lead to permanent deformity. If you suspect that you may have psoriasis, see your doctor for an examination. Also, talk to your doctor if your psoriasis: - Causes you discomfort and pain - Makes performing routine tasks difficult - Causes you concern about the appearance of your skin - Leads to joint problems, such as pain, swelling or inability to perform daily tasks Seek medical advice if your signs and symptoms worsen or don&apost improve with treatment. You may need a different medication or a combination of treatments to manage the psoriasis. The cause of psoriasis isn&apost fully understood, but it&aposs thought to be related to an immune system problem with T cells and other white blood cells, called neutrophils, in your body. T cells normally travel through the body to defend against foreign substances, such as viruses or bacteria. But if you have psoriasis, the T cells attack healthy skin cells by mistake, as if to heal a wound or to fight an infection. Overactive T cells also trigger increased production of healthy skin cells, more T cells and other white blood cells, especially neutrophils. These travel into the skin causing redness and sometimes pus in pustular lesions. Dilated blood vessels in psoriasis-affected areas create warmth and redness in the skin lesions. The process becomes an ongoing cycle in which new skin cells move to the outermost layer of skin too quickly - in days rather than weeks. Skin cells build up in thick, scaly patches on the skin&aposs surface, continuing until treatment stops the cycle. Just what causes T cells to malfunction in people with psoriasis isn&apost entirely clear. Researchers believe both genetics and environmental factors play a role. Psoriasis typically starts or worsens because of a trigger that you may be able to identify and avoid. Factors that may trigger psoriasis include: - Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections - Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, a bug bite, or a severe sunburn - Stress - Smoking - Heavy alcohol consumption - Vitamin D deficiency - Certain medications - including lithium, which is prescribed for bipolar disorder, high blood pressure medications such as beta blockers, antimalarial drugs, and iodides Anyone can develop psoriasis, but these factors can increase your risk of developing the disease: - Family history. This is one of the most significant risk factors. Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease, and having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more. - Viral and bacterial infections. People with HIV are more likely to develop psoriasis than people with healthy immune systems are. Children and young adults with recurring infections, particularly strep throat, also may be at increased risk. - Stress. Because stress can impact your immune system, high stress levels may increase your risk of psoriasis. - Obesity. Excess weight increases the risk of psoriasis. Lesions (plaques) associated with all types of psoriasis often develop in skin creases and folds. - Smoking. Smoking tobacco not only increases your risk of psoriasis but also may increase the severity of the disease. Smoking may also play a role in the initial development of the disease. In most cases, diagnosis of psoriasis is fairly straightforward. - Physical exam and medical history. Your doctor usually can diagnose psoriasis by taking your medical history and examining your skin, scalp and nails. - Skin biopsy. Rarely, your doctor may take a small sample of skin (biopsy). He or she will likely first apply a local anesthetic. The sample is examined under a microscope to determine the exact type of psoriasis and to rule out other disorders. Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Topical treatments Used alone, creams and ointments that you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis. When the disease is more severe, creams are likely to be combined with oral medications or light therapy. Topical psoriasis treatments include: - Topical corticosteroids. These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce inflammation and relieve itching and may be used with other treatments. Mild corticosteroid ointments are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as your face or skin folds, and for treating widespread patches of damaged skin. Your doctor may prescribe stronger corticosteroid ointment for smaller, less sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas. Long-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can cause thinning of the skin. Topical corticosteroids may stop working over time. It&aposs usually best to use topical corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares. - Vitamin D analogues. These synthetic forms of vitamin D slow skin cell growth. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that treats mild to moderate psoriasis along with other treatments. Calcipotriene might irritate your skin. Calcitriol (Vectical) is expensive but may be equally effective and possibly less irritating than calcipotriene. - Anthralin. This medication helps slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It&aposs usually applied for a short time and then washed off. - Topical retinoids. These are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation. The most common side effect is skin irritation. These medications may also increase sensitivity to sunlight, so while using the medication apply sunscreen before going outdoors. The risk of birth defects is far lower for topical retinoids than for oral retinoids. But tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) isn&apost recommended when you&aposre pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant. - Calcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors - tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) - reduce inflammation and plaque buildup. Calcineurin inhibitors are not recommended for long-term or continuous use because of a potential increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. They may be especially helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are too irritating or may cause harmful effects. - Salicylic acid. Available over-the-counter (nonprescription) and by prescription, salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it&aposs combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. - Coal tar. Derived from coal, coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Coal tar can irritate the skin. It&aposs also messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor. Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils. It&aposs also available in higher concentrations by prescription. This treatment isn&apost recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. - Moisturizers. Moisturizing creams alone won&apost heal psoriasis, but they can reduce itching, scaling and dryness. Moisturizers in an ointment base are usually more effective than are lighter creams and lotions. Apply immediately after a bath or shower to lock in moisture. Light therapy (phototherapy) This treatment uses natural or artificial ultraviolet light. The simplest and easiest form of phototherapy involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light, either alone or in combination with medications. - Sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight or artificial light slows skin cell turnover and reduces scaling and inflammation. Brief, daily exposures to small amounts of sunlight may improve psoriasis, but intense sun exposure can worsen symptoms and cause skin damage. Before beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your doctor about the safest way to use natural sunlight for psoriasis treatment. - UVB phototherapy. Controlled doses of UVB light from an artificial light source may improve mild to moderate psoriasis symptoms. UVB phototherapy, also called broadband UVB, can be used to treat single patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that resists topical treatments. Short-term side effects may include redness, itching and dry skin. Using a moisturizer may help decrease these side effects. - Narrow band UVB phototherapy. A newer type of psoriasis treatment, narrow band UVB phototherapy may be more effective than broadband UVB treatment. It&aposs usually administered two or three times a week until the skin improves, and then maintenance may require only weekly sessions. Narrow band UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe and longer lasting burns, however. - Goeckerman therapy. Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light. - Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). This form of photochemotherapy involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light. UVA light penetrates deeper into the skin than does UVB light, and psoralen makes the skin more responsive to UVA exposure. This more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more-severe cases of psoriasis. Short-term side effects include nausea, headache, burning and itching. Long-term side effects include dry and wrinkled skin, freckles, increased sun sensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. - Excimer laser. This form of light therapy, used for mild to moderate psoriasis, treats only the involved skin without harming healthy skin. A controlled beam of UVB light is directed to the psoriasis plaques to control scaling and inflammation. Excimer laser therapy requires fewer sessions than does traditional phototherapy because more powerful UVB light is used. Side effects can include redness and blistering. Oral or injected medications If you have severe psoriasis or it&aposs resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. - Retinoids. Related to vitamin A, this group of drugs may help if you have severe psoriasis that doesn&apost respond to other therapies. Side effects may include lip inflammation and hair loss. And because retinoids such as acitretin (Soriatane) can cause severe birth defects, women must avoid pregnancy for at least three years after taking the medication. - Methotrexate. Taken orally, methotrexate (Rheumatrex) helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It may also slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis in some people. Methotrexate is generally well-tolerated in low doses but may cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue. When used for long periods, it can cause a number of serious side effects, including severe liver damage and decreased production of red and white blood cells and platelets. - Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases your risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. Cyclosporine also makes you more susceptible to kidney problems and high blood pressure - the risk increases with higher dosages and long-term therapy. - Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics). Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. They include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections. In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis. - Other medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can&apost be given. Treatment considerations Although doctors choose treatments based on the type and severity of psoriasis and the areas of skin affected, the traditional approach is to start with the mildest treatments - topical creams and ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy) - in those patients with typical skin lesions (plaques) and then progress to stronger ones only if necessary. Patients with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis or associated arthritis usually need systemic therapy from the beginning of treatment. The goal is to find the most effective way to slow cell turnover with the fewest possible side effects. Potential future treatments There are a number of new medications currently being researched that have the potential to improve psoriasis treatment. These treatments target different proteins that work with the immune system. Alternative medicine A number of alternative therapies claim to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs. None have definitively been proved effective. But some alternative therapies are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling. These treatments would be most appropriate for those with milder, plaque disease and not for those with pustules, erythroderma or arthritis. - Aloe vera. Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation. You may need to use the cream several times a day for a month or more to see any improvements in your skin. - Fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements may reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis, although results from studies are mixed. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. - Oregon grape. Also known as barberry, topical applications of Oregon grape may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms. If you&aposre considering dietary supplements or other alternative therapy to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, consult your doctor. He or she can help you weigh the pros and cons of specific alternative therapies. Although self-help measures won&apost cure psoriasis, they may help improve the appearance and feel of damaged skin. These measures may benefit you: - Take daily baths. Bathing daily helps remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. - Use moisturizer. After bathing, apply a heavy, ointment-based moisturizer while your skin is still moist. For very dry skin, oils may be preferable - they have more staying power than creams or lotions do and are more effective at preventing water from evaporating from your skin. During cold, dry weather, you may need to apply a moisturizer several times a day. - Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. A controlled amount of sunlight can improve psoriasis, but too much sun can trigger or worsen outbreaks and increase the risk of skin cancer. First ask your doctor about the best way to use natural sunlight to treat your skin. Log your time in the sun, and protect skin that isn&apost affected by psoriasis with sunscreen. - Avoid psoriasis triggers, if possible. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. - Avoid drinking alcohol. Alcohol consumption may decrease the effectiveness of some psoriasis treatments. If you have psoriasis, avoid alcohol. If you do drink, keep it moderate.

1.85714285714	Research assignment Hi, I am a grade 12 student who is doing a research assignment on neurological disorders. Do you believe that there will ever be a bonafide cure for Multiple Sclerosis? If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?	Multiple sclerosis (Treatment): There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Treatments for MS attacks - Corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, mood swings and fluid retention. - Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven&apost responded to steroids. Treatments to modify progression For primary-progressive MS, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy. It slows worsening of disability in people with this type of MS. For relapsing-remitting MS, several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with MS occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate and slow the formation of new lesions. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat MS carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous MS treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting MS include: - Beta interferons. These medications are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat MS. They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of beta interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You&aposll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. - Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus). This humanized immunoglobulin antibody medication is the only DMT approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS. Clinical trials showed it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrevus is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Side effects may infusion-related reactions including irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, fever, and nausea among others. Ocrevus may also increase the risk of some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. - Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). This medication may help block your immune system&aposs attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. - Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. - Fingolimod (Gilenya). This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You&aposll need to have your heart rate monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include headache, high blood pressure and blurred vision. - Teriflunomide (Aubagio). This once-daily medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. It is harmful to a developing fetus and should not be used by women who may become pregnant and are not using appropriate contraception, or their male partner. - Natalizumab (Tysabri). This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe MS or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in some people. - Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada). This drug helps reduce relapses of MS by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. - Mitoxantrone. This immunosuppressant drug can be harmful to the heart and is associated with development of blood cancers. As a result, its use in treating MS is extremely limited. Mitoxantrone is usually used only to treat severe, advanced MS. Treatments for MS signs and symptoms - Physical therapy. A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with MS. - Muscle relaxants. You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may help. - Medications to reduce fatigue. - Other medications. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with MS.

If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?	what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multiple Sclerosis?: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research.

1.71428571429	Research assignment Hi, I am a grade 12 student who is doing a research assignment on neurological disorders. Do you believe that there will ever be a bonafide cure for Multiple Sclerosis? If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?	Multiple sclerosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged. Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. There&aposs no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Find out why Mayo Clinic is the best place for your care. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. They may include: - Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or the legs and trunk - Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement - Prolonged double vision - Tingling or pain in parts of your body - Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign) - Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait - Slurred speech - Fatigue - Dizziness - Problems with bowel and bladder function When to see a doctor See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Disease course Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS, but these aren&apost considered disease relapses. About 60 to 70 percent of people with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. This is known as primary-progressive MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It&aposs considered an autoimmune disease in which the body&aposs immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys myelin (the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord). Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve may be slowed or blocked. The nerve may also become damaged itself. It isn&apost clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible. These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis: - Age. MS can occur at any age, but most commonly affects people between the ages of 15 and 60. - Sex. Women are about twice as likely as men are to develop MS. - Family history. If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease. - Certain infections. A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis. - Race. White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk. - Climate. MS is far more common in countries with temperate climates, including Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe. - Certain autoimmune diseases. You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease. - Smoking. Smokers who experience an initial event of symptoms that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting MS. There are no specific tests for MS. Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. Your doctor may then recommend: - Blood tests, to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with MS are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), in which a small sample of fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with MS. Spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to MS. - MRI, which can reveal areas of MS (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. - Evoked potential tests, which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli, in which you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting MS, the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing MS can be more difficult in persons with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Treatments for MS attacks - Corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, mood swings and fluid retention. - Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body.

Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with MS. To help relieve the signs and symptoms of MS, try to: - Get plenty of rest. - Exercise. If you have mild to moderate MS, regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you&aposre bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with MS include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. - Cool down. MS symptoms often worsen when your body temperature rises. Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. - Eat a balanced diet. Results of small studies suggest that a diet low in saturated fat but high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in olive and fish oils, may be beneficial. But further research is needed. Studies also suggest that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with MS. - Relieve stress. Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Many people with MS use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of MS. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend the use of oral cannabis extract for muscle spasticity and pain, but do not recommend cannabis in any other form for other MS symptoms due to a lack of evidence. The guidelines also do not recommend the use of herbal supplements such as Ginkgo biloba and bee venom or magnetic therapy for MS symptoms.

Do you believe that there will ever be a bonafide cure for Multiple Sclerosis? If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?	Multiple Sclerosis (Summary): Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a nervous system disease that affects your brain and spinal cord. It damages the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects your nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks messages between your brain and your body, leading to the symptoms of MS. They can include - Visual disturbances - Muscle weakness - Trouble with coordination and balance - Sensations such as numbness, prickling, or "pins and needles" - Thinking and memory problems No one knows what causes MS. It may be an autoimmune disease, which happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Multiple sclerosis affects women more than men. It often begins between the ages of 20 and 40. Usually, the disease is mild, but some people lose the ability to write, speak, or walk. There is no single test for MS. Doctors use a medical history, physical exam, neurological exam, MRI, and other tests to diagnose it. There is no cure for MS, but medicines may slow it down and help control symptoms. Physical and occupational therapy may also help. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Do you believe that there will ever be a bonafide cure for Multiple Sclerosis? If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?	Multiple Sclerosis: An unpredictable disease of the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis (MS) can range from relatively benign to somewhat disabling to devastating, as communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted.  Many investigators believe MS to be an autoimmune disease -- one in which the body, through its immune system, launches a defensive attack against its own tissues. In the case of MS, it is the nerve-insulating myelin that comes under assault. Such assaults may be linked to an unknown environmental trigger, perhaps a virus. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40; the initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye.  Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance.  These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis.  Most people with MS also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feelings such as numbness, prickling, or "pins and needles" sensations.  Some may also experience pain.  Speech impediments, tremors, and dizziness are other frequent complaints. Occasionally, people with MS have hearing loss. Approximately half of all people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked.  Depression is another common feature of MS. Currently there is no cure for MS. Many individuals do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.  However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.  The FDA has also approved ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe.  The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third.  Other FDA approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate.  An immunosuppressant treatment,Novantrone (mitoxantrone), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS.  The FDA has also approved dalfampridine (Ampyra) to improve walking in individuals with MS. One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.  However, in 2005 the drug’s manufacturer voluntarily suspended marketing of the drug after several reports of significant adverse events.  In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians.  While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.  Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.  Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.  If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.  Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used. A physician may diagnose MS in some patients soon after the onset of the illness. In others, however, doctors may not be able to readily identify the cause of the symptoms, leading to years of uncertainty and multiple diagnoses punctuated by baffling symptoms that mysteriously wax and wane.  The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk.  MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment.
1.90909090909	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	Prostate Cancer: The prostate gland makes fluid that forms part of semen. The prostate lies just below the bladder in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and out of the body). Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, after skin cancer. It is the second leading cause of death from cancer in men. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. Almost all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Prostate cancer often has no early symptoms. Advanced prostate cancer can cause men to urinate more often or have a weaker flow of urine, but these symptoms can also be caused by benign prostate conditions. Prostate cancer usually grows very slowly. Most men with prostate cancer are older than 65 years and do not die from the disease. Finding and treating prostate cancer before symptoms occur may not improve health or help you live longer. Talk to your doctor about your risk of prostate cancer and whether you need screening tests. - Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate. - Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination. - Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate. - Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination. - Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for prostate cancer: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for prostate cancer: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. - Seven types of standard treatment are used: - Watchful waiting or active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy - Hormone therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy - There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Cryosurgery - High-intensity-focused ultrasound therapy - Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. - Seven types of standard treatment are used: - Watchful waiting or active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy - Hormone therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy - There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Cryosurgery - High-intensity-focused ultrasound therapy - Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed.

-0.272727272727	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	Who is at risk for Prostate Cancer??: Scientists don&apost know exactly what causes prostate cancer. They cannot explain why one man gets prostate cancer and another does not. However, they have been able to identify some risk factors that are associated with the disease. A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease. Age Age is the most important risk factor for prostate cancer. The disease is extremely rare in men under age 40, but the risk increases greatly with age. More than 60 percent of cases are diagnosed in men over age 65. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 65. Race Race is another major risk factor. In the United States, this disease is much more common in African American men than in any other group of men. It is least common in Asian and American Indian men. Family History A man&aposs risk for developing prostate cancer is higher if his father or brother has had the disease. Other Risk Factors Scientists have wondered whether obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, radiation exposure, might increase risk. But at this time, there is no firm evidence that these factors contribute to an increased risk.

-0.363636363636	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	Who is at risk for Prostate Cancer??: Yes. Race is another major risk factor. In the United States, this disease is much more common in African American men than in any other group of men. It is least common in Asian and American Indian men. A man&aposs risk for developing prostate cancer is higher if his father or brother has had the disease. Diet also may play a role. There is some evidence that a diet high in animal fat may increase the risk of prostate cancer and a diet high in fruits and vegetables may decrease the risk. Studies to find out whether men can reduce their risk of prostate cancer by taking certain dietary supplements are ongoing.
2.0	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	Prostate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your doctor must think about include: - Your age and other medical problems you may have - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment - How much the prostate cancer has spread - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices: - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: - Appetite loss - Diarrhea - Erection problems - Fatigue - Rectal burning or injury - Skin reactions - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. - The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum - Red-brown urine or semen - Impotence - Incontinence - Urinary retention - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body&aposs testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body&aposs immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

-0.818181818182	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	Familial prostate cancer: Familial prostate cancer is a cluster of prostate cancer within a family. Most cases of prostate cancer occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. However, approximately 5% to 10% of prostate cancer cases are believed to be primarily caused by a genetic predisposition to the condition. [1] In many families, the underlying genetic cause is unknown; however, some of these cases are caused by changes ( mutations ) in the BRCA1 , BRCA2, HOXB13, or several other genes . Other cases are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle.

Some studies are looking at the genes of men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively young age, less than 55 years old, and the genes of families who have several members with the disease. Other studies are trying to identify which genes, or arrangements of genes, are most likely to lead to prostate cancer. Much more work is needed, however, before scientists can say exactly how genetic changes relate to prostate cancer. At the moment, no genetic risk has been firmly established.
-0.727272727273	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	Cryotherapy for prostate cancer: Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer. Before the procedure, you will be given medicine so that you do not feel pain. You may receive: - A sedative to make you drowsy and numbing medicine on your perineum. This is the area between the anus and scrotum. - Anesthesia. With spinal anesthesia, you will be drowsy but awake, and numb below the waist. With general anesthesia, you will be asleep and pain-free. First, you will get a catheter that will stay in place for about 3 weeks after the procedure. Then, the doctor makes small cuts to place several hollow needles into your perineum. - Ultrasound is used to guide the needles to the prostate gland. - Then, very cold gas passes through the needles, creating ice balls that destroy the prostate gland. - Warm salt water will flow through the catheter to keep your urethra (the tube from the bladder to outside the body) from freezing. Cryosurgery is most often a 2-hour outpatient procedure. Some people may need to stay in the hospital overnight. This therapy is not as commonly used and is not as well accepted as other treatments for prostate cancer. Doctors do not know for certain how well cryosurgery works over time. There is not enough data to compare it with standard prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or brachytherapy. It can only treat prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate. Men who cannot have surgery because of their age or other health problems may have cryosurgery instead. It also may be used if cancer comes back after other treatments. It is generally not helpful for men with very large prostate glands. Possible short-term side effects of cryotherapy for prostate cancer include: - Blood in the urine - Trouble passing urine - Swelling of the penis or scrotum - Problems controlling your bladder (more likely if you have had radiation therapy also) Possible long-term problems include: - Erection problems in nearly all people - Damage to the rectum - A tube that forms between the rectum and the bladder, called a fistula (this is very rare) - Problems with passing or controlling urine.

-0.909090909091	prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision	prostate cancer: Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or later. In this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. Men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen (PSA) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. As the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. However, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer. The severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. Early-stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. In other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening. Some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. The signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. If prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips. A small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. These hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary prostate cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases. About 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some time during their life. In addition, studies indicate that many older men have undiagnosed prostate cancer that is non-aggressive and unlikely to cause symptoms or affect their lifespan. While most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die from it, this common cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. More than 60 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed after age 65, and the disorder is rare before age 40. In the United States, African Americans have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than do men of other ethnic backgrounds, and they also have a higher risk of dying from the disease. Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In most cases of prostate cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a man&aposs lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the prostate. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in prostate cancer cells. Less commonly, genetic changes present in essentially all of the body&aposs cells increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. These genetic changes, which are classified as germline mutations, are usually inherited from a parent. In people with germline mutations, changes in other genes, together with environmental and lifestyle factors, also influence whether a person will develop prostate cancer. Inherited mutations in particular genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and HOXB13, account for some cases of hereditary prostate cancer. Men with mutations in these genes have a high risk of developing prostate cancer and, in some cases, other cancers during their lifetimes. In addition, men with BRCA2 or HOXB13 gene mutations may have a higher risk of developing life-threatening forms of prostate cancer. The proteins produced from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA, which helps to maintain the stability of a cell&aposs genetic information. For this reason, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are considered to be tumor suppressors, which means that they help keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in these genes impair the cell&aposs ability to fix damaged DNA, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor. The HOXB13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the HOXB13 gene is called a transcription factor. Like BRCA1 and BRCA2, the HOXB13 protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor. HOXB13 gene mutations may result in impairment of the protein&aposs tumor suppressor function, resulting in the uncontrolled cell growth and division that can lead to prostate cancer. Inherited variations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for prostate cancer. Some of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact with the proteins produced from the BRCA1, BRCA2, or HOXB13 genes. Others act as tumor suppressors through different pathways. Changes in these genes probably make only a small contribution to overall prostate cancer risk. However, researchers suspect that the combined influence of variations in many of these genes may significantly impact a person&aposs risk of developing this form of cancer. In many families, the genetic changes associated with hereditary prostate cancer are unknown. Identifying additional genetic risk factors for prostate cancer is an active area of medical research. In addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that may contribute to a person&aposs risk of developing prostate cancer. These factors include a high-fat diet that includes an excess of meat and dairy and not enough vegetables, a largely inactive (sedentary) lifestyle, obesity, excessive alcohol use, or exposure to certain toxic chemicals. A history of prostate cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor, particularly if the cancer occurred at an early age. Many cases of prostate cancer are not related to inherited gene changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the prostate. When prostate cancer is related to inherited gene changes, the way that cancer risk is inherited depends on the gene involved. For example, mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and HOXB13 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person&aposs chance of developing cancer. In other cases, the inheritance of prostate cancer risk is unclear. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop cancer. Bambury RM, Gallagher DJ. Prostate cancer: germline prediction for a commonly variable malignancy.

-1.77777777778	Rubella My grandson (4 yrs old) has contracted Rubella. I know for sure he has had at least one of the vaccines. They are living in Mexico right now. Should we be worried?	Congenital rubella (Summary): Congenital rubella refers to the group of birth defects that occur in an infant whose mother is infected with the virus that causes German measles (rubella) during pregnancy. Congenital rubella occurs when the rubella virus in the mother affects the developing baby in the first 3 months of pregnancy. After the fourth month, if the mother has a rubella infection, it is less likely to harm the developing baby. [1] The most common problems are hearing loss due to damage to the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain ( sensorineural hearing loss ), ocular abnormalities ( cataract , infantile glaucoma , and pigmentary retinopathy) and heart problems. Other symptoms and signs may include intrauterine growth retardation,  prematurity, stillbirth, miscarriage, neurological problems ( intellectual disability , low muscle tone, very small head), liver and spleen enlargement ( hepatosplenomegaly ), jaundice , skin problems, anemia , hormonal problems, and other issues. [2]  The number of babies born with congenital rubella is much less since the rubella vaccine was developed. Pregnant women who are not vaccinated for rubella and who have not had the disease in the past risk infecting themselves and their unborn baby.

0.666666666667	Rubella My grandson (4 yrs old) has contracted Rubella. I know for sure he has had at least one of the vaccines. They are living in Mexico right now. Should we be worried?	Rubella: Rubella, also called German measles or three-day measles, is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. Rubella is not the same as measles (rubeola), though the two illnesses do share some characteristics, including the red rash. However, rubella is caused by a different virus than measles, and is neither as infectious nor usually as severe as measles. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, usually given to children in the United States twice before they reach school age, is highly effective in preventing rubella. Because of widespread use of the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared rubella eliminated in the United States, but cautions parents to make sure their children are vaccinated to prevent its reemergence. The signs and symptoms of rubella are often so mild they&aposre difficult to notice, especially in children. If signs and symptoms do occur, they generally appear between two and three weeks after exposure to the virus. They typically last about two to three days and may include: - Mild fever of 102 F (38.9 C) or lower - Headache - Stuffy or runny nose - Inflamed, red eyes - Enlarged, tender lymph nodes at the base of the skull, the back of the neck and behind the ears - A fine, pink rash that begins on the face and quickly spreads to the trunk and then the arms and legs, before disappearing in the same sequence - Aching joints, especially in young women When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you think you or your child may have been exposed to rubella or if you have the signs or symptoms listed above. If you&aposre contemplating getting pregnant, check your vaccination record to make sure you&aposve received your MMR inoculations. If a pregnant woman contracts rubella, especially during her first trimester, the virus can cause death or serious birth defects in her developing fetus. Rubella during pregnancy is the most common cause of congenital deafness. It&aposs best for women to be protected against rubella before pregnancy. If you&aposre pregnant, you&aposll likely undergo a routine screening for immunity to rubella. But if you&aposve never received the vaccine and think you might have been exposed to rubella, contact your doctor immediately. A blood test might confirm that you&aposre already immune. The cause of rubella is a virus that&aposs passed from person to person. It can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or it can spread by direct contact with an infected person&aposs respiratory secretions, such as mucus. It can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her unborn child via the bloodstream. A person with rubella is contagious from 10 days before the onset of the rash until about one or two weeks after the rash disappears. An infected person can spread the illness before the person realizes he or she has it. Rubella is rare in the United States because most children receive a vaccination against the infection at an early age. However, cases of rubella do occur, mostly in unvaccinated foreign-born adults. The disease is still common in many parts of the world. The prevalence of rubella in other countries is something to consider before going abroad, especially if you&aposre pregnant. Rubella is a mild infection. Once you&aposve had the disease, you&aposre usually permanently immune. Some women with rubella experience arthritis in the fingers, wrists and knees, which generally lasts for about one month. In rare cases, rubella can cause an ear infection (otitis media) or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). However, if you&aposre pregnant when you contract rubella, the consequences for your unborn child may be severe. Up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who had rubella during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy develop congenital rubella syndrome. This syndrome can cause one or more problems, including: - Growth retardation - Cataracts - Deafness - Congenital heart defects - Defects in other organs - Mental retardation The highest risk to the fetus is during the first trimester, but exposure later in pregnancy also is dangerous. The rubella rash can look like many other viral rashes. So doctors usually confirm rubella with the help of laboratory tests. You may have a virus culture or a blood test, which can detect the presence of different types of rubella antibodies in your blood. These antibodies indicate whether you&aposve had a recent or past infection or a rubella vaccine. No treatment will shorten the course of rubella infection, and symptoms are so mild that treatment usually isn&apost necessary. However, doctors often recommend isolation from others - especially pregnant women - during the infectious period. If you contract rubella while you&aposre pregnant, discuss the risks to your baby with your doctor. If you wish to continue your pregnancy, you may be given antibodies called hyperimmune globulin that can fight off the infection. This can reduce your symptoms, but doesn&apost eliminate the possibility of your baby developing congenital rubella syndrome. Support of an infant born with congenital rubella syndrome varies depending on the extent of the infant&aposs problems. Children with multiple complications may require early treatment from a team of specialists. In rare instances when a child or adult is infected with rubella, simple self-care measures are required: - Rest in bed as necessary. - Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to relieve discomfort from fever and aches. - Tell friends, family and co-workers - especially pregnant women - about your diagnosis if they may have been exposed to the disease. - Avoid people who have conditions that cause deficient or suppressed immune systems. - Tell your child&aposs school or child care provider that your child has rubella.

1.57142857143	Is it necessary to go to the dr. when getting a skull fracture?	Skull fracture: A skull fracture is a fracture or break in the cranial (skull) bones. Skull fractures may occur with head injuries. The skull provides good protection for the brain. However, a severe impact or blow can cause the skull to break. It may be accompanied by concussion or other injury to the brain. The brain can be affected directly by damage to the nervous system tissue and bleeding. The brain can also be affected by bleeding under the skull . This can compress the underlying brain tissue (subdural or epidural hematoma). A simple fracture is a break in the bone without damage to the skin. A linear skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone resembling a thin line, without splintering, depression, or distortion of bone. A depressed skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone (or "crushed" portion of skull) with depression of the bone in toward the brain. A compound fracture involves a break in, or loss of, skin and splintering of the bone. Causes of skull fracture can include: - Head trauma - Falls, automobile accidents, physical assault, and sports Symptoms may include: - Bleeding from wound, ears, nose, or around eyes - Bruising behind the ears or under the eyes - Changes in pupils (sizes unequal, not reactive to light) - Confusion - Convulsions - Difficulties with balance - Drainage of clear or bloody fluid from ears or nose - Drowsiness - Headache - Loss of consciousness - Nausea and vomiting - Restlessness, irritability - Slurred speech - Stiff neck - Swelling - Visual disturbances In some cases, the only symptom may be a bump on the head. A bump or bruise may take up to 24 hours to develop. Take the following steps if you think someone has a skull fracture: - Check the airways, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR. - Avoid moving the person (unless absolutely necessary) until medical help arrives. Have someone to call 911 (or the local emergency number) for medical assistance. - If the person must be moved, take care to stabilize the head and neck. Place your hands on both sides of the head and under the shoulders. Do not allow the head to bend forward or backward, or to twist or turn. - Carefully check the site of injury, but do not probe in or around the site with a foreign object. It can be hard to know if the skull is fractured or depressed (dented in) at the site of injury. - If there is bleeding, apply firm pressure with a clean cloth over a broad area to control blood loss. - If blood soaks through, do not remove the original cloth. Instead, apply more cloths on top, and continue to apply pressure. - If the person is vomiting, stabilize the head and neck, and carefully turn the victim to the side to prevent choking on vomit. - If the person is conscious and experiencing any of the previously listed symptoms, transport to the nearest emergency medical facility (even if the person does not think medical help is needed). Follow these precautions: - Do NOT move the person unless absolutely necessary. Head injuries may be associated with spinal injuries. - Do NOT remove protruding objects. - Do NOT allow the person to continue with physical activities. - Do NOT forget to watch the person closely until medical help arrives. - Do NOT give the person any medicines before talking to a doctor. - Do NOT leave the person alone, even if there are no obvious problems. Get medical help right away if: - There are problems with breathing or circulation. - Direct pressure does not stop bleeding from the nose, ears, or wound. - There is drainage of clear fluid from the nose or ears. - There is facial swelling, bleeding, or bruising. - There is an object protruding from the skull. - The person is unconscious, is experiencing convulsions, has multiple injuries, appears to be in any distress, or cannot think clearly. Not all head injuries can be prevented. The following simple steps can help keep you and your child safe: - Always use safety equipment during activities that could cause a head injury. These include seat belts, bicycle or motorcycle helmets, and hard hats. - Learn and follow bicycle safety recommendations. - Do not drink and drive. Do not allow yourself to be driven by someone who may have been drinking alcohol or is otherwise impaired.

2.0	spina bifida; vertbral fusion;syrinx tethered cord. can u help for treatment of these problem	Spina bifida (Treatment): Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn&apost require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it&aposs not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother&aposs uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby&aposs spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It&aposs important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that&aposs associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby&aposs body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby&aposs brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they&aposre older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child&aposs medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child&aposs condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible.

1.57142857143	spina bifida; vertbral fusion;syrinx tethered cord. can u help for treatment of these problem	Spina bifida: Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don&apost form properly. It falls under the broader category of neural tube defects. The neural tube is the embryonic structure that eventually develops into the baby&aposs brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. Normally, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy, and it closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine. Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of defect, size, location and complications. When early treatment for spina bifida is necessary, it&aposs done surgically, although such treatment doesn&apost always completely resolve the problem. Types Spina bifida can occur in different forms: spina bifida occulta, meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel) or myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel). The severity of spina bifida depends on the type, size, location and complications. "Occulta" means hidden. The mildest form, spina bifida occulta results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people who have spina bifida occulta don&apost even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons. In a form of spina bifida called meningocele, the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the opening in the vertebrae, forming a sac filled with fluid. But this sac doesn&apost include the spinal cord, so nerve damage is less likely, though later complications are possible. Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe form. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby&aposs back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections. Signs and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity. Symptoms can also differ for each person. - Spina bifida occulta. Because the spinal nerves usually aren&apost involved, typically there are no signs or symptoms. But visible indications can sometimes be seen on the newborn&aposs skin above the spinal defect, including an abnormal tuft of hair, or a small dimple or birthmark. - Meningocele. The membranes around the spinal cord push out through an opening in the vertebrae, forming a sac filled with fluid, but this sac doesn&apost include the spinal cord. - Myelomeningocele. In this severe form of spina bifida: - The spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. - Both the membranes and the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac. - Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. When to see a doctor Typically, meningocele and myelomeningocele are diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available. These children should be followed by a specialized team of doctors throughout their lives and families should be educated on the different complications to watch for. Children with spina bifida occulta typically don&apost have any symptoms or complications, so usually only routine pediatric care is needed. Doctors aren&apost certain what causes spina bifida. As with many other problems, it appears to result from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folate deficiency. Spina bifida is more common among whites and Hispanics, and females are affected more often than males. Although doctors and researchers don&apost know for sure why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors: - Folate deficiency. Folate (vitamin B-9) is important to the healthy development of a baby. Folate is the natural form of vitamin B-9. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. - Family history of neural tube defects. Couples who&aposve had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect. That risk increases if two previous children have been affected by the condition. In addition, a woman who was born with a neural tube defect has a greater chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition. - Some medications. For example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid (Depakene), seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy, possibly because they interfere with the body&aposs ability to use folate and folic acid. - Diabetes. Women with diabetes who don&apost control their blood sugar well have a higher risk of having a baby with spina bifida. - Obesity. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida. - Increased body temperature. Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. Elevating your core body temperature, due to fever or the use of saunas or hot tubs, has been associated with a possible slight increased risk of spina bifida. If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your doctor to determine if you need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins. If you take medications, tell your doctor. Some medications can be adjusted to diminish the potential risk of spina bifida, if plans are made ahead of time. Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or only minor physical disabilities. If the spina bifida is severe, sometimes it leads to more significant physical disabilities. Severity is affected by: - The size and location of the neural tube defect - Whether skin covers the affected area - Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord This list of possible complications may seem overwhelming, but not all children with spina bifida get all these complications. And these conditions can be treated. - Walking and mobility problems. The nerves that control the leg muscles don&apost work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect, causing muscle weakness of the legs, sometimes involving paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth. - Orthopedic complications. Children with myelomeningocele can have a variety of problems in the legs and spine because of weak muscles in the legs and back. The types of problems depend on the level of the defect. Possible problems include a curved spine (scoliosis), abnormal growth or dislocation of the hip, bone and joint deformities, muscle contractures and other orthopedic concerns. - Bowel and bladder problems. Nerves that supply the bladder and bowels usually don&apost work properly when children have myelomeningocele. This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord. - Accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly experience accumulation of fluid in the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus. - Shunt malfunction. Shunts can stop working or become infected. Warning signs may vary. Some of the warning signs of a shunt that isn&apost working include headaches, vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, swelling or redness along the shunt, confusion, changes in the eyes (fixed downward gaze), trouble feeding, or seizures. - Chiari malformation type II. Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type II is a common brain abnormality in children with the myelomeningocele form of spina bifida. The brainstem, or lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord, is elongated and positioned lower than usual. This can cause problems with breathing and swallowing. Rarely, compression on this area of the brain occurs and surgery is needed to relieve the pressure. - Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis). Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. This potentially life-threatening infection may cause brain injury. - Tethered spinal cord. Tethered spinal cord results when the spinal nerves become bound to the scar where the defect was closed surgically, making the spinal cord less able to grow as the child grows. This progressive tethering can cause loss of muscle function to the legs, bowel or bladder. Surgery can limit the degree of disability. - Sleep-disordered breathing. Both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, may have sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. Assessment for a sleep disorder in those with myelomeningocele helps detect sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, which warrants treatment to improve health and quality of life. - Skin problems. Children with spina bifida may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or back. They can&apost feel when they get a blister or sore. Sores or blisters can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of wound problems in casts. - Latex allergy. Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of latex allergy, an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. Latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. It can also cause anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which swelling of the face and airways can make breathing difficult. So it&aposs best to use latex-free gloves and equipment at delivery time and when caring for a child with spina bifida. - Other complications. More problems may arise as children with spina bifida get older, such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and depression. Children with myelomeningocele may develop learning disabilities, such as problems paying attention, and difficulty learning reading and math. If you&aposre pregnant, you&aposll be offered prenatal screening tests to check for spina bifida and other birth defects. The tests aren&apost perfect. Some mothers who have positive blood tests have normal babies. Even if the results are negative, there&aposs still a small chance that spina bifida is present. Talk to your doctor about prenatal testing, its risks and how you might handle the results. Blood tests Your doctor will most likely check for spina bifida by first performing these tests: - Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test. For the MSAFP test, a sample of the mother&aposs blood is drawn and tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) - a protein produced by the baby. It&aposs normal for a small amount of AFP to cross the placenta and enter the mother&aposs bloodstream. But abnormally high levels of AFP suggest that the baby has a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida, though some spina bifida cases don&apost produce high levels of AFP. - Test to confirm high AFP levels. Varying levels of AFP can be caused by other factors - including a miscalculation in fetal age or multiple babies - so your doctor may order a follow-up blood test for confirmation. If the results are still high, you&aposll need further evaluation, including an ultrasound exam. - Other blood tests. Your doctor may perform the MSAFP test with two or three other blood tests. These tests are commonly done with the MSAFP test, but their objective is to screen for other abnormalities, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), not neural tube defects. Ultrasound Many obstetricians rely on ultrasonography to screen for spina bifida. If blood tests indicate high AFP levels, your doctor will suggest an ultrasound exam to help determine why. The most common ultrasound exams bounce high-frequency sound waves off tissues in your body to form images on a video monitor. The information these images provide can help establish whether there&aposs more than one baby and can help confirm gestational age, two factors that can affect AFP levels. An advanced ultrasound also can detect signs of spina bifida, such as an open spine or particular features in your baby&aposs brain that indicate spina bifida. Amniocentesis If a blood test shows high levels of AFP in your blood but the ultrasound is normal, your doctor may offer amniocentesis. During amniocentesis, your doctor uses a needle to remove a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby. An analysis of the sample indicates the level of AFP present in the amniotic fluid. A small amount of AFP is normally found in amniotic fluid. However, when an open neural tube defect is present, the amniotic fluid contains an elevated amount of AFP because the skin surrounding the baby&aposs spine is gone and AFP leaks into the amniotic sac. Discuss the risks of amniocentesis, including a slight risk of loss of the pregnancy, with your doctor. Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn&apost require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it&aposs not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother&aposs uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby&aposs spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It&aposs important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that&aposs associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby&aposs body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby&aposs brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they&aposre older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child&aposs medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child&aposs condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible.
0.428571428571	spina bifida; vertbral fusion;syrinx tethered cord. can u help for treatment of these problem	Spina Bifida (Are there associated conditions?): Health issues are different for each person with spina bifida. Open spina bifida (myelomeningocele)—in which the spinal cord is exposed—tends to cause more severe problems. Hydrocephalus Many infants born with spina bifida get extra fluid in and around the brain, a condition called hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. The extra fluid can cause swelling of the head, which may lead to brain injury. Chiari II Malformation The brains of most children with open spina bifida are positioned abnormally. The lower part of the brain rests farther down than normal, partially in the upper spinal canal. The cerebrospinal (pronounced suh-ree-broh-SPAHYN-l) fluid can get blocked and cause hydrocephalus. While most affected children have no other symptoms, a few may have upper body weakness and trouble breathing and swallowing. Tethered Spinal Cord Typically, the bottom of the spinal cord floats freely in the spinal canal, but for many people with spina bifida, the spinal cord is attached to the spinal canal. Thus, the spinal cord stretches as a person grows, and this stretching can cause spinal nerve damage. The person might have back pain, scoliosis (crooked spine, pronounced skoh-lee-OH-sis), weakness in the legs and feet, bladder or bowel control problems, and other issues. Paralysis, Mobility Limitations People with spina bifida high on the back (near the head, for instance) might not be able to move their legs. People with spina bifida low on the back (near the hips, for example) might have some leg mobility and be able to walk unassisted or with crutches, braces, or walkers. Lack of Bladder and Bowel Control People with spina bifida often cannot control their bladder and bowel movements. They also can develop urinary tract infections. Latex Allergy Many people with spina bifida—possibly three-quarters of those with the condition—are allergic to latex, or natural rubber. While researchers still don’t entirely understand why the rate in those with spina bifida is so high, some experts believe such an allergy can be caused by frequent exposure to latex, which is common for people with spina bifida who have shunts and have had many surgeries. Learning Disabilities While at least 80% of children with open spina bifida do not have learning deficiencies, some do have learning problems. Other Conditions Some people with open spina bifida have additional physical and psychological conditions, including digestive, vision, sexual, social, and emotional problems; obesity; and depression. « Is there a cure?

Please could you tell me how I contact a specialist to enquire further with this...Thank you...	Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of disorders which affect the voluntary muscles around the hips and shoulders. The conditions are progressive, leading to a loss of muscle strength and bulk over a number of years. Onset may occur in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or even later. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. [1] Most forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several rare forms are inherited in an  autosomal dominant pattern. [2] While there are no treatments which directly reverse the muscle weakness associated with this condition, supportive treatment can decrease the complications. [3] There are at least 20 different types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. [1] Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is most often inherited in an  autosomal recessive manner; less commonly, rare sub-types may be inherited in an  autosomal dominant manner.  There may be difficulties diagnosing the condition accurately, and often the mode of inheritance cannot be determined. Therefore, it may be challenging to determine the exact recurrence risks for some families. Establishing the type of LGMD in an affected individual can be useful for discussing the clinical course of the disease as well as for determining who else in the family may be at risk for the condition. [4] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Unfortunately, no definitive treatments for LGMD exist.

1.0	Subcutaneous retrocalcaneal bursitis Haglund&aposs deformity of the calcaneum. I have this problem. Can you please help to overcome this?	Bursitis of the heel (Treatment): Your provider may recommend that you do the following: - Avoid activities that cause pain. - Put ice on the heel several times a day. - Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. - Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel. - Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation. Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back. If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture). If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.

0.875	Subcutaneous retrocalcaneal bursitis Haglund&aposs deformity of the calcaneum. I have this problem. Can you please help to overcome this?	Bursitis of the heel: Bursitis of the heel is swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the back of the heel bone. A bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone. There are bursas around most large joints in the body, including the ankle. The retrocalcaneal bursa is located in the back of the ankle by the heel. It is where the large Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. Repeated or too much use of the ankle can cause this bursa to become irritated and inflamed. It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping. This condition is very often linked to Achilles tendinitis. Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis. Risks for this condition include: - Starting a very intense workout schedule - Suddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning - Changes in activity level  - History of arthritis that is caused by inflammation Symptoms include: - Pain in the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched - Pain may get worse when rising on the toes (standing on tiptoes) - Red, warm skin over the back of the heel Your health care provider will take a history to find out if you have symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis. An exam will be done to find the location of the pain. The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel. The pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex). Or, the pain may be worse when you rise on your toes. Most of the time, you will not need imaging studies such as x-ray and MRI at first. You may need these tests later if the first treatments DO NOT lead to improvement. Inflammation may show on a MRI. Your provider may recommend that you do the following: - Avoid activities that cause pain. - Put ice on the heel several times a day. - Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. - Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel. - Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation. Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back. If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture). If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa. This condition most often gets better in several weeks with the proper treatment. Call your provider if you have heel pain or symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis that DO NOT improve with rest. Things you can do to prevent the problem include: - Use proper form when exercising. - Maintain as good flexibility and strength around the ankle to help prevent this condition. - Stretch the Achilles tendon to help prevent injury. - Wear shoes with enough arch support to decrease the amount of stress on the tendon and inflammation in the bursa.

1.0	subjective vertigo Can macular degeneration in only one eye cause dizziness?	Dizziness: Dizziness is a term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or unsteady. Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It&aposs usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) - Lightheadedness or feeling faint - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache - Ongoing vomiting - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing - Stumbling or difficulty walking - Fainting - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate - Numbness or weakness - Shortness of breath - A high fever - A very stiff neck - A head injury - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it&aposs caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it&aposs moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren&apost consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you&aposre spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis. - Meniere&aposs disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It&aposs characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they&aposre not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn&apost pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension. - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson&aposs disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance. - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much. - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia). - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety. - Overheating and dehydration. If you&aposre active in hot weather, or if you don&apost drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They&aposre also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness. - A past episode of dizziness. If you&aposve experienced dizziness before, you&aposre more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you&aposre having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere&aposs disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It&aposs usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that&aposs rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn&apost responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you&aposre experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren&apost as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others).
0.875	subjective vertigo Can macular degeneration in only one eye cause dizziness?	What is Macular Degeneration?: Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked. Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision. NIH: National Eye Institute

-0.888888888889	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration (Prevention): To prevent dehydration: - Drink plenty of fluids every day, even when you are well. Drink more when the weather is hot or you are exercising. - If anyone in your family is ill, pay attention to how much they are able to drink. Pay close attention to children and older adults. - Anyone with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids. DO NOT wait for signs of dehydration. - If you think you or someone in your family may become dehydrated, call your provider. Do this before the person becomes dehydrated.

0.666666666667	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration: Dehydration occurs when you use or lose more fluid than you take in, and your body doesn&apost have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. If you don&apost replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated. Anyone may become dehydrated, but the condition is especially dangerous for young children and older adults. The most common cause of dehydration in young children is severe diarrhea and vomiting. Older adults naturally have a lower volume of water in their bodies, and may have conditions or take medications that increase the risk of dehydration. This means that even minor illnesses, such as infections affecting the lungs or bladder, can result in dehydration in older adults. Dehydration also can occur in any age group if you don&apost drink enough water during hot weather - especially if you are exercising vigorously. You can usually reverse mild to moderate dehydration by drinking more fluids, but severe dehydration needs immediate medical treatment. Thirst isn&apost always a reliable early indicator of the body&aposs need for water. Many people, particularly older adults, don&apost feel thirsty until they&aposre already dehydrated. That&aposs why it&aposs important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you&aposre ill. The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age. - Dry mouth and tongue - No tears when crying - No wet diapers for three hours - Sunken eyes, cheeks - Sunken soft spot on top of skull - Listlessness or irritability - Extreme thirst - Less frequent urination - Dark-colored urine - Fatigue - Dizziness - Confusion Call your family doctor if you or a loved one: - Has had diarrhea for 24 hours or more - Is irritable or disoriented and much sleepier or less active than usual - Can&apost keep down fluids - Has bloody or black stool Sometimes dehydration occurs for simple reasons: You don&apost drink enough because you&aposre sick or busy, or because you lack access to safe drinking water when you&aposre traveling, hiking or camping. Other dehydration causes include: - Diarrhea, vomiting. Severe, acute diarrhea - that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently - can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time. If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals. - Fever. In general, the higher your fever, the more dehydrated you may become. The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting. - Excessive sweating. You lose water when you sweat. If you do vigorous activity and don&apost replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated. Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose. - Increased urination. This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes. Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more. Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain people are at greater risk: - Infants and children. The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration. Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns. Young children often can&apost tell you that they&aposre thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves. - Older adults. As you age, your body&aposs fluid reserve becomes smaller, your ability to conserve water is reduced and your thirst sense becomes less acute. These problems are compounded by chronic illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, and by the use of certain medications. Older adults also may have mobility problems that limit their ability to obtain water for themselves. - People with chronic illnesses. Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration. Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination. Even having a cold or sore throat makes you more susceptible to dehydration because you&aposre less likely to feel like eating or drinking when you&aposre sick. - People who work or exercise outside. When it&aposs hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases. That&aposs because when the air is humid, sweat can&apost evaporate and cool you as quickly as it normally does, and this can lead to an increased body temperature and the need for more fluids. Dehydration can lead to serious complications, including: - Heat injury. If you don&apost drink enough fluids when you&aposre exercising vigorously and perspiring heavily, you may end up with a heat injury, ranging in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion or potentially life-threatening heatstroke. - Urinary and kidney problems. Prolonged or repeated bouts of dehydration can cause urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure. - Seizures. Electrolytes - such as potassium and sodium - help carry electrical signals from cell to cell. If your electrolytes are out of balance, the normal electrical messages can become mixed up, which can lead to involuntary muscle contractions and sometimes to a loss of consciousness. - Low blood volume shock (hypovolemic shock). This is one of the most serious, and sometimes life-threatening, complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. Your doctor can often diagnose dehydration on the basis of physical signs and symptoms. If you&aposre dehydrated, you&aposre also likely to have low blood pressure, especially when moving from a lying to a standing position, a faster than normal heart rate and reduced blood flow to your extremities. To help confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the degree of dehydration, you may have other tests, such as: - Blood tests. Blood samples may be used to check for a number of factors, such as the levels of your electrolytes - especially sodium and potassium - and how well your kidneys are working. - Urinalysis. Tests done on your urine can help show whether you&aposre dehydrated and to what degree. They also can check for signs of a bladder infection. The only effective treatment for dehydration is to replace lost fluids and lost electrolytes. The best approach to dehydration treatment depends on age, the severity of dehydration and its cause. For infants and children who have become dehydrated from diarrhea, vomiting or fever, use an over-the-counter oral rehydration solution. These solutions contain water and salts in specific proportions to replenish both fluids and electrolytes. Start with about a teaspoon (5 milliliters) every one to five minutes and increase as tolerated. It may be easier to use a syringe for very young children. Older children can be given diluted sports drinks. Use 1 part sports drink to 1 part water. Most adults with mild to moderate dehydration from diarrhea, vomiting or fever can improve their condition by drinking more water or other liquids. Diarrhea may be worsened by full-strength fruit juice and soft drinks. If you work or exercise outdoors during hot or humid weather, cool water is your best bet. Sports drinks containing electrolytes and a carbohydrate solution also may be helpful. Children and adults who are severely dehydrated should be treated by emergency personnel arriving in an ambulance or in a hospital emergency room. Salts and fluids delivered through a vein (intravenously) are absorbed quickly and speed recovery.
0.777777777778	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration: Dehydration occurs when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it should. Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how much of your body&aposs fluid is lost or not replaced. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency. You can become dehydrated if you lose too much fluid, do not drink enough water or fluids, or both. Your body may lose a lot of fluid from: - Sweating too much, for example, from exercising in hot weather - Fever - Vomiting or diarrhea - Urinating too much (uncontrolled diabetes or some medications, like diuretics, can cause you to urinate a lot) You might not drink enough fluids because: - You do not feel like eating or drinking because you are sick - You are nauseated - You have a sore throat or mouth sores Older adults and people with certain diseases, such as diabetes, are also at higher risk for dehydration. Signs of mild to moderate dehydration: - Thirst - Dry or sticky mouth - Not urinating much - Darker yellow urine - Dry, cool skin - Headache - Muscle cramps Signs of severe dehydration: - Not urinating, or very dark yellow or amber-colored urine - Dry, shriveled skin - Irritability or confusion - Dizziness or light-headedness - Rapid heartbeat - Rapid breathing - Sunken eyes - Listlessness - Shock (not enough blood flow through the body) - Unconsciousness or delirium Your health care provider will look for these signs of dehydration: - Low blood pressure - Blood pressure that drops when you stand up after lying down - White finger tips that do not return to a pink color after your doctor presses the fingertip - Skin that is not as elastic as normal. When the provider pinches it into a fold, it may slowly sag back into place. Normally, skin springs back right away. - Rapid heart rate Your doctor may do lab tests: - Blood tests to check kidney function - Urine tests to see what may be causing dehydration - Other tests to see what may be causing dehydration (blood sugar test for diabetes) To treat dehydration: - Try sipping water or sucking on ice cubes. - Try drinking water or sports drinks that contain electrolytes. - Do not take salt tablets. They can cause serious complications. - Ask your provider what you should eat if you have diarrhea. For more severe dehydration or heat emergency, you may need to stay in a hospital and receive fluid through a vein (IV). The provider will also treat the cause of the dehydration. Dehydration caused by a stomach virus should get better on its own after a few days. If you notice signs of dehydration and treat it quickly, you should recover completely. Untreated severe dehydration may cause: - Death - Permanent brain damage - Seizures You should call 911 if: - The person loses consciousness at any time. - There is any other change in the person&aposs alertness (for example, confusion or seizures). - The person has a fever over 102°F (38.8°C). - You notice symptoms of heatstroke (such as rapid pulse or rapid breathing). - The person&aposs condition does not improve or gets worse despite treatment. To prevent dehydration: - Drink plenty of fluids every day, even when you are well. Drink more when the weather is hot or you are exercising. - If anyone in your family is ill, pay attention to how much they are able to drink. Pay close attention to children and older adults. - Anyone with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids. DO NOT wait for signs of dehydration. - If you think you or someone in your family may become dehydrated, call your provider. Do this before the person becomes dehydrated. Updated by: Laura J.

-0.666666666667	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration (Causes): Sometimes dehydration occurs for simple reasons: You don&apost drink enough because you&aposre sick or busy, or because you lack access to safe drinking water when you&aposre traveling, hiking or camping. Other dehydration causes include: - Diarrhea, vomiting. Severe, acute diarrhea - that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently - can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time. If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals. - Fever. In general, the higher your fever, the more dehydrated you may become. The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting. - Excessive sweating. You lose water when you sweat. If you do vigorous activity and don&apost replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated. Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose. - Increased urination. This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes. Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more.
-0.555555555556	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration (Diagnosis): Your doctor can often diagnose dehydration on the basis of physical signs and symptoms. If you&aposre dehydrated, you&aposre also likely to have low blood pressure, especially when moving from a lying to a standing position, a faster than normal heart rate and reduced blood flow to your extremities. To help confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the degree of dehydration, you may have other tests, such as: - Blood tests. Blood samples may be used to check for a number of factors, such as the levels of your electrolytes - especially sodium and potassium - and how well your kidneys are working. - Urinalysis. Tests done on your urine can help show whether you&aposre dehydrated and to what degree. They also can check for signs of a bladder infection.
0.888888888889	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration (Summary): Summary When you&aposre dehydrated, your body doesn&apost have enough fluid and electrolytes to work properly. An average person on an average day needs about 3 quarts of water. But if you&aposre out in the hot sun or are exercising a lot, you need a lot more than that. You can also become dehydrated if you are vomiting, have diarrhea, or are sweating a lot. People who are elderly, very young, taking certain medications, or have a chronic illness have a greater risk. Signs of dehydration in adults include - Being thirsty - Urinating less often than usual - Dark-colored urine - Dry skin - Feeling tired - Dizziness and fainting Signs of dehydration in babies and young children include a dry mouth and tongue, crying without tears, no wet diapers for 3 hours or more, a high fever and being unusually sleepy or drowsy. If you think you&aposre dehydrated, drink small amounts of water over a period of time. Drinking too much all at once can overload your stomach and make you throw up. If you are exercising in the heat and losing a lot of minerals in sweat, sports drinks can be helpful. Avoid any drinks that have caffeine. NIH: National Institutes of Health
-0.444444444444	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration (Treatment): The only effective treatment for dehydration is to replace lost fluids and lost electrolytes. The best approach to dehydration treatment depends on age, the severity of dehydration and its cause. For infants and children who have become dehydrated from diarrhea, vomiting or fever, use an over-the-counter oral rehydration solution. These solutions contain water and salts in specific proportions to replenish both fluids and electrolytes. Start with about a teaspoon (5 milliliters) every one to five minutes and increase as tolerated. It may be easier to use a syringe for very young children. Older children can be given diluted sports drinks. Use 1 part sports drink to 1 part water. Most adults with mild to moderate dehydration from diarrhea, vomiting or fever can improve their condition by drinking more water or other liquids. Diarrhea may be worsened by full-strength fruit juice and soft drinks. If you work or exercise outdoors during hot or humid weather, cool water is your best bet. Sports drinks containing electrolytes and a carbohydrate solution also may be helpful. Children and adults who are severely dehydrated should be treated by emergency personnel arriving in an ambulance or in a hospital emergency room. Salts and fluids delivered through a vein (intravenously) are absorbed quickly and speed recovery.
-0.777777777778	symptoms of dehydration When a person is very dehydrated do they sometimes get a tight pain in their chest (right below the breasts) right before they faint/pass out?	Dehydration (Risk factors): Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain people are at greater risk: - Infants and children. The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration. Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns. Young children often can&apost tell you that they&aposre thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves. - Older adults. As you age, your body&aposs fluid reserve becomes smaller, your ability to conserve water is reduced and your thirst sense becomes less acute. These problems are compounded by chronic illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, and by the use of certain medications. Older adults also may have mobility problems that limit their ability to obtain water for themselves. - People with chronic illnesses. Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration. Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination. Even having a cold or sore throat makes you more susceptible to dehydration because you&aposre less likely to feel like eating or drinking when you&aposre sick. - People who work or exercise outside. When it&aposs hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases. That&aposs because when the air is humid, sweat can&apost evaporate and cool you as quickly as it normally does, and this can lead to an increased body temperature and the need for more fluids.

And i want know the cost of treatment . Thank you Regards /	Coloboma of optic nerve (Summary): Coloboma of the optic nerve is a congenital eye abnormality in which the optic nerve (which carries images of what the eye sees to the brain) is incompletely formed. The condition may occur in one or both eyes. The degree of visual impairment varies widely depending on the severity and structures involved. Serous detachments of the retina commonly occur in affected people, with a high risk for extensive retinal detachment. The coloboma may be associated with other features, such as a small eye (microphthalmia) with or without a cyst; small cornea (microcornea); or coloboma of other eye structures. Although the condition is present from birth, diagnosis may be delayed since the coloboma is inside the eye and not visible by simple inspection. Coloboma of the optic nerve may occur sporadically, may be due to a genetic mutation and be inherited , or may occur as a feature of an underlying syndrome or other genetic condition. There is no treatment to correct an optic nerve coloboma, but low vision aids may be helpful for some people. [1] [2] [3]
1.5	treatment options versus migraine types Migraine seems to be a spectrum of conditions rather than only one easily diagnosed affliction. Many innovative migraine treatments are now in use, but it seems that each treatment only addresses a narrow set of conditions; for example, my daughter has tried many different treatment options (QEEG, HEG, TMS, topamax, ...) without success. Has any research been done to characterize which treatment types are effective against which migraine types?	Migraine (Treatment): There is no absolute cure for migraine since its pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood.  There are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks. Prevention involves the use of medications and behavioral changes.  Drugs originally developed for epilepsy, depression, or high blood pressure to prevent future attacks have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine.  Behaviorally, stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, biofeedback mechanisms, and other therapies designed to limit daily discomfort, may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks.  Making a log of personal triggers of migraine can also provide useful information for trigger-avoiding lifestyle changes, including dietary considerations, eating regularly scheduled meals with adequate hydration, stopping certain medications, and establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle. A weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine. Relief of symptoms, or acute treatments, during attacks consists of sumatriptan, ergotamine drugs, and analgesics such as ibuprofen and aspirin.  The sooner these treatments are administered, the more effective they are.

Has any research been done to characterize which treatment types are effective against which migraine types?	Migraine (Treatment): There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers. If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include: - Antidepressants - Blood pressure medicines - Seizure medicines Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month. Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. TREATING AN ATTACK Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that: - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine. - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys. If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections. The group of medicines most often used is called triptans. Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself. Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs.
1.88888888889	typhoid fever Hi, My name is from X i have suffering from typhoid please give me solution i have one question i had got treatment from one year but i am not well now give me solution?	Typhoid fever (Treatment): Antibiotic therapy is the only effective treatment for typhoid fever. Commonly prescribed antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin (Cipro). In the United States, doctors often prescribe this for nonpregnant adults. - Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). This injectable antibiotic is an alternative for people who may not be candidates for ciprofloxacin, such as children. These drugs can cause side effects, and long-term use can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Problems with antibiotic resistance In the past, the drug of choice was chloramphenicol. Doctors no longer commonly use it, however, because of side effects, a high rate of health deterioration after a period of improvement (relapse) and widespread bacterial resistance. In fact, the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in the treatment of typhoid fever, especially in the developing world. In recent years, S. typhi also has proved resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. Other treatments Other treatments include: - Drinking fluids. This helps prevent the dehydration that results from a prolonged fever and diarrhea. If you&aposre severely dehydrated, you may need to receive fluids through a vein (intravenously). - Surgery. If your intestines become perforated, you&aposll need surgery to repair the hole.
2.0	typhoid fever Hi, My name is from X i have suffering from typhoid please give me solution i have one question i had got treatment from one year but i am not well now give me solution?	What are the treatments for Typhoid fever?: Fluids and electrolytes may be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets. Antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria. There are increasing rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world, so your health care provider will check current recommendations before choosing an antibiotic.
1.77777777778	typhoid fever Hi, My name is from X i have suffering from typhoid please give me solution i have one question i had got treatment from one year but i am not well now give me solution?	Typhoid fever: Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in industrialized countries. However, it remains a serious health threat in the developing world, especially for children. Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or through close contact with someone who&aposs infected. Signs and symptoms usually include high fever, headache, abdominal pain, and either constipation or diarrhea. Most people with typhoid fever feel better within a few days of starting antibiotic treatment, although a small number of them may die of complications. Vaccines against typhoid fever are available, but they&aposre only partially effective. Vaccines usually are reserved for those who may be exposed to the disease or are traveling to areas where typhoid fever is common. Signs and symptoms are likely to develop gradually - often appearing one to three weeks after exposure to the disease. Early illness Once signs and symptoms do appear, you&aposre likely to experience: - Fever that starts low and increases daily, possibly reaching as high as 104.9 F (40.5 C) - Headache - Weakness and fatigue - Muscle aches - Sweating - Dry cough - Loss of appetite and weight loss - Abdominal pain - Diarrhea or constipation - Rash - Extremely swollen abdomen Later illness If you don&apost receive treatment, you may: - Become delirious - Lie motionless and exhausted with your eyes half-closed in what&aposs known as the typhoid state In addition, life-threatening complications often develop at this time. In some people, signs and symptoms may return up to two weeks after the fever has subsided. When to see a doctor See a doctor immediately if you suspect you have typhoid fever. If you become ill while traveling in a foreign country, call the U.S. Consulate for a list of doctors. Better yet, find out in advance about medical care in the areas you&aposll visit, and carry a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of recommended doctors. If you develop signs and symptoms after you return home, consider consulting a doctor who focuses on international travel medicine or infectious diseases. A specialist may be able to recognize and treat your illness more quickly than can a doctor who isn&apost familiar with these areas. Typhoid fever is caused by virulent bacteria called Salmonella typhi (S. typhi). Although they&aposre related, S. typhi and the bacteria responsible for salmonellosis, another serious intestinal infection, aren&apost the same. Fecal-oral transmission route The bacteria that cause typhoid fever spread through contaminated food or water and occasionally through direct contact with someone who is infected. In developing nations, where typhoid fever is endemic, most cases result from contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation. The majority of people in industrialized countries pick up typhoid bacteria while traveling and spread it to others through the fecal-oral route. This means that S. typhi is passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. You can contract the infection if you eat food handled by someone with typhoid fever who hasn&apost washed carefully after using the toilet. You can also become infected by drinking water contaminated with the bacteria. Typhoid carriers Even after treatment with antibiotics, a small number of people who recover from typhoid fever continue to harbor the bacteria in their intestinal tracts or gallbladders, often for years. These people, called chronic carriers, shed the bacteria in their feces and are capable of infecting others, although they no longer have signs or symptoms of the disease themselves. Typhoid fever remains a serious worldwide threat - especially in the developing world - affecting an estimated 26 million or more people each year. The disease is endemic in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and many other areas. Worldwide, children are at greatest risk of getting the disease, although they generally have milder symptoms than adults do. If you live in a country where typhoid fever is rare, you&aposre at increased risk if you: - Work in or travel to areas where typhoid fever is endemic - Work as a clinical microbiologist handling Salmonella typhi bacteria - Have close contact with someone who is infected or has recently been infected with typhoid fever - Drink water contaminated by sewage that contains S. typhi Intestinal bleeding or holes The most serious complications of typhoid fever - intestinal bleeding or holes (perforations) in the intestine - may develop in the third week of illness. A perforated intestine occurs when your small intestine or large bowel develops a hole, causing intestinal contents to leak into your abdominal cavity and triggering signs and symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and bloodstream infection (sepsis). This life-threatening complication requires immediate medical care. Other, less common complications Other possible complications include: - Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) - Inflammation of the lining of the heart and valves (endocarditis) - Pneumonia - Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) - Kidney or bladder infections - Infection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meningitis) - Psychiatric problems, such as delirium, hallucinations and paranoid psychosis With prompt treatment, nearly all people in industrialized nations recover from typhoid fever. Without treatment, some people may not survive complications of the disease. Medical and travel history Your doctor is likely to suspect typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history. But the diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying S. typhi in a culture of your blood or other body fluid or tissue. Body fluid or tissue culture For the culture, a small sample of your blood, stool, urine or bone marrow is placed on a special medium that encourages the growth of bacteria. The culture is checked under a microscope for the presence of typhoid bacteria. A bone marrow culture often is the most sensitive test for S. typhi. Although performing a culture test is the mainstay for diagnosis, in some instances other testing may be used to confirm a suspected typhoid fever infection, such as a test to detect antibodies to typhoid bacteria in your blood or a test that checks for typhoid DNA in your blood. Antibiotic therapy is the only effective treatment for typhoid fever. Commonly prescribed antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin (Cipro). In the United States, doctors often prescribe this for nonpregnant adults. - Ceftriaxone (Rocephin).

0.666666666667	typhoid fever Hi, My name is from X i have suffering from typhoid please give me solution i have one question i had got treatment from one year but i am not well now give me solution?	Typhoid fever: Typhoid fever is an infection that causes diarrhea and a rash. It is most commonly caused due to a bacteria called Salmonella typhi (S typhi). S typhi is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body. Some people become carriers of S typhi and continue to release the bacteria in their stools for years, spreading the disease. Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Fewer than 400 cases are reported in the US each year. Most cases in the US are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common. Early symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain. High fever (103°F, or 39.5°C) or higher and severe diarrhea occur as the disease gets worse. Some people develop a rash called "rose spots," which are small red spots on the abdomen and chest. Other symptoms that occur include: - Abdominal tenderness - Bloody stools - Chills - Agitation, confusion, delirium, seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations) - Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit) - Mood swings - Nosebleeds - Severe fatigue - Slow, sluggish, weak feeling A complete blood count (CBC) will show a high number of white blood cells. A blood culture during the first week of the fever can show S typhi bacteria. Other tests that can help diagnose this condition include: - ELISA urine test to look for the bacteria that cause Typhoid fever - Fluorescent antibody study to look for substances that are specific to Typhoid bacteria - Platelet count (platelet count may be low) - Stool culture Fluids and electrolytes may be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets. Antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria. There are increasing rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world, so your health care provider will check current recommendations before choosing an antibiotic. Symptoms usually improve in 2 to 4 weeks with treatment. The outcome is likely to be good with early treatment, but becomes poor if complications develop. Symptoms may return if the treatment has not completely cured the infection. Health problems that may develop include: - Intestinal hemorrhage (severe GI bleeding) - Intestinal perforation - Kidney failure - Peritonitis Call your health care provider if you have any of the following: - You know you have been exposed to someone who has typhoid fever - You have been in an area where there are people who have typhoid fever and you develop symptoms of typhoid fever - You have had typhoid fever and the symptoms return - You develop severe abdominal pain, decreased urine output, or other new symptoms A vaccine is recommended for travel outside of the US to places where there is typhoid fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has information about where typhoid fever is common -- www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/typhoid_fever. Ask your provider if you should bring electrolyte packets in case you get sick. When traveling, drink only boiled or bottled water and eat well-cooked food. Water treatment, waste disposal, and protecting the food supply from contamination are important public health measures. Carriers of typhoid must not be allowed to work as food handlers.

It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults. Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox: - From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister - If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases. Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers&apos blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox. Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.
-0.1	varicella shingles How can I determine whether or not I&aposve had chicken pox. If there is a test for it, what are the results of the tests I need to know that will tell me whether or not I have had chicken pox? I want to know this to determine if I should have shingles vaccine (Zostavax) Thank you.	What is Chickenpox (varicella) vaccine - what you need to know?: Why get vaccinated? Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. - It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. - It can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. - The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. - A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. - Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. - Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. Who should get chickenpox vaccine and when? Routine Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: - 1st Dose: 12 to 15 months of age - 2nd Dose: 4 to 6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. Catch-up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person&aposs age. Ask your doctor. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A "combination" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both chickenpox and MMR vaccines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait. - People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. - People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. - Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. - Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: - Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer - Has any kind of cancer - Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs - People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. Ask your provider for more information. Ask your doctor for more information. What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose than after the second. Mild problems - Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) - Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) - Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this is extremely rare. Moderate problems - Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare). Severe problems - Pneumonia (very rare) Other serious problems, including severe brain reactions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMRV. These usually occur 5 to 12 days after the first dose. What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can&apost wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website. How can I learn more? - Ask your doctor. - Contact your local or state health department. - Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) - Visit CDC&aposs vaccines website

Chickenpox (Symptoms): Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears: - Fever - Headache - Stomach ache The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin. - The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp. - After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids. - Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Some children who have had the vaccine will still develop a mild case of chickenpox. In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others.

Chickenpox (Prevention): Because chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid. A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child&aposs routine vaccine schedule. The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild. Talk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed. Taking preventive steps right away may be important. Giving the vaccine early after exposure may still reduce the severity of the disease.

Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important for those who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others.

Other problems may include: - Reye syndrome - Infection of the heart muscle - Pneumonia - Joint pain or swelling Cerebellar ataxia may appear during the recovery phase or later. This involves a very unsteady walk. Women who get chickenpox during pregnancy can pass the infection to the developing baby. Newborns are at risk for severe infection.
0.555555555556	Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy Would like to obtain more info on possible treatments.	vitelliform macular dystrophy: Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a genetic eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. This disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become blurry or distorted. Vitelliform macular dystrophy typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night. Researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. The early-onset form (known as Best disease) usually appears in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. The adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be detected during an eye examination. Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the BEST1 and PRPH2 genes cause vitelliform macular dystrophy. BEST1 mutations are responsible for Best disease and for some cases of the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy. Changes in the PRPH2 gene can also cause the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy; however, less than a quarter of all people with this form of the condition have mutations in the BEST1 or PRPH2 gene. In most cases, the cause of the adult-onset form is unknown. The BEST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. This protein acts as a channel that controls the movement of charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) into or out of cells in the retina. Mutations in the BEST1 gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride. Researchers have not determined how these malfunctioning channels are related to the buildup of lipofuscin in the macula and progressive vision loss. The PRPH2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin 2. This protein is essential for the normal function of light-sensing (photoreceptor) cells in the retina. Mutations in the PRPH2 gene cause vision loss by disrupting structures in these cells that contain light-sensing pigments. It is unclear why PRPH2 mutations affect only central vision in people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. Best disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. The inheritance pattern of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is uncertain. Some studies have suggested that this disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is difficult to be sure, however, because many affected people have no history of the disorder in their family, and only a small number of affected families have been reported.

0.777777777778	Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy Would like to obtain more info on possible treatments.	Best vitelliform macular dystrophy: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a slowly progressive form of macular degeneration. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but age of onset and severity of vision loss can vary. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. [1] BVMD is characterized by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (The retina is the back part of the eye that contains the specialized cells that respond to light, known as  photoreceptors) and impaired central visual function. [2] BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene ; in a few cases the cause is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of low vision aids, and direct laser treatment or photodynamic therapy. Newer treatment includes anti-VEGF agents ( bevacizumab) and transcorneal electrical retinal stimulation. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cystoid macular degeneration Very frequent Metamorphopsia Very frequent Visual impairment Very frequent Abnormality of color vision Frequent Choroideremia Occasional Visual field defect Occasional Abnormal electroretinogram - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Macular dystrophy - Reduced visual acuity - Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the gene . [1] This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD. [3] Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a few cases with autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. [1] In autosomal dominant inheritance, having one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Most people with BVMD have an affected parent, but some people have the condition as the result of a new mutation that occurred for the first time. [1] Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (EOG); and the family history . An eye exam may include other tests as well. A fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. The EOG, which reflects the retinal pigmentary epithelium function, is the most diagnostic test for evaluating vitelliform macular dystrophy. In the majority of the cases, a severe decrease occurs in light response, reflected by an Arden (light-peak/dark-trough) ratio of 1.1-1.5. (The normal Arden ratio is 1.8.) Carriers will also have an abnormal EOG result.  No correlation exists between EOG result and disease stage, visual acuity, or patient age. EOG results are usually symmetric for both eyes. [4] The family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. [1] Genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of BVMD. A BEST1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. In people with no family history of BVMD, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. A mutation in BEST1 gene is more probable when a vitelliform lesion is accompanied by a reduced Arden ratio on EOG testing. The exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person&aposs ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered. [1] There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time. [5] [4] Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity. [6] Laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such as bevacizumab have shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina).

Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy: Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) is an eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. AVMD affects an area of the retina called the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells. [1] AVMD usually begins after age 40. Some people remain without symptoms throughout their life. Other people with AVMD may slowly develop blurred and/or distorted vision, that can progress to central vision loss over time. [1] [2] In the past, AVMD was believed to be mainly a genetic disorder caused by  mutations in the PRPH2,  BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes ; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that the genetic cause for most cases of AVMD has not been found. [2] [3] Sometimes AVMD clearly runs in families in an  autosomal dominant manner, but the inheritance is suspected to be more complicated in the majority of cases. [1] [2] Signs and symptoms of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy typically begin during mid-adulthood, in the fourth or fifth decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, mild blurring or mildly distorted vision may be present. In most cases, the cells underlying the macula become more damaged over time, which can cause slowly progressive vision loss. The condition is usually affects both eyes. [2] [3] It usually does not affect peripheral vision or the ability to see at night. [1] Studies have revealed much variability in the signs, symptoms and progression of this condition. Some people with AVMD do not have any visual symptoms throughout their life. Others may experience ongoing visual loss, but for most people the vision loss is not severe. In general, the long-term outlook ( prognosis ) is usually good, but loss of central visual function is possible. [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

Historically, adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) was defined as a genetic disorder; however, recent studies have concluded that only a minority of cases have an identified genetic cause, suggesting that there might be other underlying causes of environmental origin, genetic origin, or a mix of genetics and environment (multifactorial).  More studies are needed to better define other underlying causes that might be present, whether of genetic or environmental origin. [2] [3]  Currently known genetic causes include  mutations  in the  PRPH2,  BEST1,  IMPG1, and  IMPG2  genes . It is additionally suspected that AVMD might be associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (variant DNA sequence ) in the  HTRA1 gene. Single- nucleotide polymorphisms in the  HTRA1 gene are additionally associated with age-related macular degeneration. [2] [3] The majority of cases with an identified family history or genetic cause are inherited in an  autosomal dominant mutation ) in one copy of the responsible  gene  in each cell . In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from a new ( de novo) mutation in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When caused by a known mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, a person with adult-onset macular dystrophy (AVMD) has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.  The inheritance pattern of AVMD can be confusing as not all individuals with AVMD have a family history and not all individuals who inherit a causative gene mutation develop symptoms. [1] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. There is no cure or known treatment to stop the progression of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. [2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]  CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]  Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life. [4] [5]

[2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]  CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]  Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life. [4] [5]
2.0	williams sydrome conditon. i need to send me more information about Williams Syndrome and some tips how to educate people with this disorder.I hope having news from you soon!!thank you	Williams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person&aposs family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: - Blood pressure check - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person&aposs symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams Syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- www.williams-syndrome.org About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability. Most people will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications. Most people require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes. Complications may include: - Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems - Death (in rare cases from anesthesia) - Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels - Pain in the abdomen Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.

2.0	Would appreciate any good info on Lewy Body Dementia, we need to get people aware of this dreadful disease, all they talk about is alzheimers. Thank you	Lewy body dementia (Overview): Lewy body dementia, also known as dementia with Lewy bodies, is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer&aposs disease dementia. Protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, develop in nerve cells in the brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement (motor control). Lewy body dementia causes a progressive decline in mental abilities. People with Lewy body dementia may experience visual hallucinations, and changes in alertness and attention. Other effects include Parkinson&aposs disease-like symptoms such as rigid muscles, slow movement and tremors. Lewy body dementia care at Mayo Clinic

Thank you	What are the treatments for Dementia With Lewy Bodies?: There is no cure for DLB. Treatments are aimed at controlling the cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms of the disorder. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, are primarily used to treat the cognitive symptoms of DLB, but they may also be of some benefit in reducing the psychiatric and motor symptoms. Doctors tend to avoid prescribing antipsychotics for hallucinatory symptoms of DLB because of the risk that neuroleptic sensitivity could worsen the motor symptoms. Some individuals with DLB may benefit from the use of levodopa for their rigidity and loss of spontaneous movement.

0.5	Would appreciate any good info on Lewy Body Dementia, we need to get people aware of this dreadful disease, all they talk about is alzheimers. Thank you	Lewy body dementia (Treatment): Treatment can be challenging, and there&aposs no cure for Lewy body dementia. Doctors treat the individual symptoms. Medications - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These Alzheimer&aposs disease medications, such as rivastigmine (Exelon), work by increasing the levels of chemical messengers believed to be important for memory, thought and judgment (neurotransmitters) in the brain. This can help improve alertness and cognition, and may help reduce hallucinations and other behavioral problems. Possible side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, excessive salivation and tearing, and frequent urination. These are not FDA approved for Lewy body dementia. - Parkinson&aposs disease medications. These medications, such as carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) may help reduce parkinsonian symptoms, such as rigid muscles and slow movement. However, these medications may also increase confusion, hallucinations and delusions. - Medications to treat other symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat other symptoms associated with Lewy body dementia, such as sleep or movement problems. If possible, avoid medications with anticholinergic properties, which can worsen cognition or dopamine agonists, which can cause hallucinations. First-generation antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol (Haldol), should not be used to treat Lewy body dementia. They may cause severe confusion, severe Parkinsonism, sedation and sometimes even death. Very rarely, certain second-generation antipsychotics may be prescribed for a short time at a low dose but only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Therapies Because antipsychotic drugs can worsen Lewy body dementia symptoms, it might be helpful to initially try nondrug approaches, such as: - Tolerating the behavior. Many times a person with Lewy body dementia isn&apost distressed by the hallucinations. In these cases, the side effects of medication may be worse than the hallucinations themselves. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and distracting noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to function. - Offering soothing responses. A caregiver&aposs response may worsen behavior. Avoid correcting and quizzing a person with dementia. Offer reassurance and validation of his or her concerns. - Creating daily routines and keeping tasks simple. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on successes, not failures. Structure and routine during the day can be less confusing.
1.0	would you help me to fine article or jurnal about Cri du chat syndrome	Cri du chat syndrome (Summary): Cri du chat syndrome is a group of symptoms that result from missing a piece of chromosome number 5. The syndrome&aposs name is based on the infant&aposs cry, which is high-pitched and sounds like a cat.
0.8	would you help me to fine article or jurnal about Cri du chat syndrome	Cri du chat syndrome (Causes): Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5. Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child.
0.6	would you help me to fine article or jurnal about Cri du chat syndrome	cri-du-chat syndrome (Genetic Changes): Cri-du-chat syndrome is caused by a deletion of the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5. This chromosomal change is written as 5p-. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals; studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and developmental delay than smaller deletions. The signs and symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 5. Researchers believe that the loss of a specific gene, CTNND2, is associated with severe intellectual disability in some people with this condition. They are working to determine how the loss of other genes in this region contributes to the characteristic features of cri-du-chat syndrome.
-1.8	would you help me to fine article or jurnal about Cri du chat syndrome	cri-du-chat syndrome (Frequency): Cri-du-chat syndrome occurs in an estimated 1 in 20,000 to 50,000 newborns. This condition is found in people of all ethnic backgrounds.
0.4	would you help me to fine article or jurnal about Cri du chat syndrome	Cri du chat syndrome (Treatment): While there is no specific treatment available for cri du chat syndrome , early intervention is recommended in the areas of physical therapy (achieving physical and motor milestones such as sitting and standing up), communication (speech therapy, sign language instruction), behavioral modification (for hyperactivity, short attention span, aggression), and learning (special education). [3] Because symptoms may vary from individual to individual, we recommend discussing these options with a health care professional to develop a personalized plan for therapy.

-0.625	how common is cystic fibrosis	What is cystic fibrosis?: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body&aposs organs. The disorder&aposs most common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems. The features of the disorder and their severity varies among affected individuals. Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the linings of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. In people with cystic fibrosis, the body produces mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This abnormal mucus can clog the airways, leading to severe problems with breathing and bacterial infections in the lungs. These infections cause chronic coughing, wheezing, and inflammation. Over time, mucus buildup and infections result in permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs. Most people with cystic fibrosis also have digestive problems. Some affected babies have meconium ileus, a blockage of the intestine that occurs shortly after birth. Other digestive problems result from a buildup of thick, sticky mucus in the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that produces insulin (a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels). It also makes enzymes that help digest food. In people with cystic fibrosis, mucus blocks the ducts of the pancreas, reducing the production of insulin and preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines to aid digestion. Problems with digestion can lead to diarrhea, malnutrition, poor growth, and weight loss. In adolescence or adulthood, a shortage of insulin can cause a form of diabetes known as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (CFRDM). Cystic fibrosis used to be considered a fatal disease of childhood. With improved treatments and better ways to manage the disease, many people with cystic fibrosis now live well into adulthood. Adults with cystic fibrosis experience health problems affecting the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. Most men with cystic fibrosis have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a condition in which the tubes that carry sperm (the vas deferens) are blocked by mucus and do not develop properly. Men with CBAVD are unable to father children (infertile) unless they undergo fertility treatment. Women with cystic fibrosis may experience complications in pregnancy.
0.875	how common is cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s. Cystic fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it&aposs important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) - Wheezing - Breathlessness - Exercise intolerance - Repeated lung infections - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren&apost able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools - Poor weight gain and growth - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing. In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition. Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won&apost develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. - Family history. Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families. - Race. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes). - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps). - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood. - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness. - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can&apost absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins. - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30. - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones. - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion. - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it&aposs possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure. To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors may conduct several tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means treatment can begin immediately. In one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical (immunoreactive trypsinogen, or IRT) released by the pancreas. A newborn&aposs IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may also conduct genetic tests to test for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. To evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test when the infant is at least 2 weeks old. In a sweat test, doctors apply a sweat-producing chemical to a small area of skin. They then collect the sweat to test it and see if it&aposs saltier than normal. Testing may be done at a center specializing in cystic fibrosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren&apost screened at birth. Your doctor may suggest genetic and sweat tests for cystic fibrosis if you have recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), nasal polyps, chronic sinus or lung infections, bronchiectasis, or male infertility. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms and reduce complications. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended. Managing cystic fibrosis is complex, so consider obtaining treatment at a center staffed by doctors and other staff trained in cystic fibrosis. Doctors may work with a multidisciplinary team of doctors and medical professionals trained in cystic fibrosis to evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: - Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs - Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs - Treating and preventing intestinal blockage - Providing adequate nutrition Medications The options may include: - Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections - Anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs - Mucus-thinning drugs to help you cough up the mucus, which can improve lung function - Inhaled medications called bronchodilators that can help keep your airways open by relaxing the muscles around your bronchial tubes - Oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene mutations, doctors may recommend a newer medication called ivacaftor (Kalydeco). This medication may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with cystic fibrosis who are age 6 and older. The dose depends on your weight and age. Doctors may conduct liver function tests and eye examinations before prescribing ivacaftor and on a regular basis while you&aposre taking it to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. For people with a certain gene mutation who are age 12 and older, another drug (Orkambi) is available that combines ivacaftor with a medication called lumacaftor. The combination of these medications may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, some people may experience side effects such as chest discomfort and shortness of breath soon after starting the medication. Some people may also have high blood pressure while taking the medication. Doctors may monitor you for any side effects. Chest physical therapy Loosening the thick mucus in the lungs makes it easier to cough up. Chest physical therapy helps loosen mucus. It is usually done from one to four times a day. A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. Certain breathing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus. Your doctor will instruct you about the type of chest physical therapy he or she recommends for you. Mechanical devices also can help loosen lung mucus. These include a vibrating vest or a tube or mask you breathe into. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: - Physical exercise that may improve your condition - Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing - Nutritional counseling - Counseling and support - Education about your condition Surgical and other procedures - Nasal polyp removal. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. - Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Endoscopy and lavage. Mucus may be suctioned from obstructed airways through an endoscope. - Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can&apost absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest temporarily using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition while you sleep. This tube may be inserted in your nose and guided to your stomach, or it may be surgically implanted into the abdomen. - Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a section of bowel has folded in on itself, also may require surgical repair. - Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with cystic fibrosis - such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas problems and osteoporosis - can still occur after a lung transplant. You can manage your condition and minimize complications in several ways. Always talk to your doctor before starting home remedies. Cystic fibrosis can cause malnourishment because the enzymes needed for digestion can&apost reach your small intestine, preventing food from being absorbed. People with cystic fibrosis may need a significantly higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to maintain good lung function. It&aposs also important to drink lots of fluids, which can help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to develop a nutrition plan. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. In addition, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids - Supplemental high-calorie nutrition - Special fat-soluble vitamins - Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage - Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising - Adequate water during hot weather In addition to other usual childhood vaccines, people with cystic fibrosis should have the annual flu vaccine and any other vaccines their doctor recommends. Cystic fibrosis doesn&apost affect the immune system, but children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to develop complications when they become sick. Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways, and strengthens your heart. For many people with cystic fibrosis, participating in sports can improve confidence and self-esteem. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Don&apost smoke in your home or car, and don&apost allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke is harmful for everyone, but especially for people with cystic fibrosis. Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a person who is sick. Hand-washing is the best way to protect against infection. You&aposll have ongoing care from your doctor and other medical professionals. Make sure to attend your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medications as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Contact your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as severe constipation, more mucus than usual, blood in your mucus or reduced energy.
2.0	how common is cystic fibrosis	Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (SIS-tik fi-BRO-sis), or CF, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-KREH-tor-ee) glands. Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. "Inherited" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease—one from each parent. The parents likely don&apost have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can&apost reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can&apost fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you&aposre also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term "infertility" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you&aposll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you&aposll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body&aposs cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn&apost work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes—one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are "CF carriers." CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don&apost know that they&aposre CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you&aposll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby&aposs skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn&apost pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They&aposre related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that&aposs sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don&apost respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don&apost. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can&apost fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they&aposre born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren&apost moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn&aposs pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you&aposre pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby&aposs CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you&aposre planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you&aposre a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation&aposs Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that&aposs deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They&aposre often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven&apost worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person&aposs diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn&apost replace medical therapy. Instead, it&aposs used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that&aposs rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can&apost absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you&aposre sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you&aposll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation&aposs Care Center Network Web page. It&aposs standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that&aposs dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don&apost have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child&aposs health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you&aposre planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you&aposre very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.
0.75	how common is cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families. It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas. The buildup of mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man&aposs reproductive system. Many people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms. This is because a person with CF must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some white Americans have the CF gene. It is more common among those of northern or central European descent. Most children with CF are diagnosed by age 2. For a small number, the disease is not detected until age 18 or older. These children often have a milder form of the disease. Symptoms in newborns may include: - Delayed growth - Failure to gain weight normally during childhood - No bowel movements in first 24 to 48 hours of life - Salty-tasting skin Symptoms related to bowel function may include: - Belly pain from severe constipation - Increased gas, bloating, or a belly that appears swollen (distended) - Nausea and loss of appetite - Stools that are pale or clay-colored, foul smelling, have mucus, or that float - Weight loss Symptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include: - Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs - Fatigue - Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps - Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite) - Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps Symptoms that may be noticed later in life: - Infertility (in men) - Repeated inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) - Respiratory symptoms - Clubbed fingers A blood test is done to help detect CF. The test looks for changes in the CF gene. Other tests used to diagnose CF include: - Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) test is a standard newborn screening test for CF. A high level of IRT suggests possible CF and requires further testing. - Sweat chloride test is the standard diagnostic test for CF. A high salt level in the person&aposs sweat is a sign of the disease. Other tests that identify problems that can be related to CF include: - Chest x-ray or CT scan - Fecal fat test - Lung function tests - Measurement of pancreatic function - Secretin stimulation test - Trypsin and chymotrypsin in stool - Upper GI and small bowel series An early diagnosis of CF and treatment plan can improve both survival and quality of life. Follow-up and monitoring are very important. When possible, care should be received at a cystic fibrosis specialty clinic. When children reach adulthood, they should transfer to a cystic fibrosis specialty center for adults. Treatment for lung problems includes: - Antibiotics to prevent and treat lung and sinus infections. They may be taken by mouth, or given in the veins or by breathing treatments. People with CF may take antibiotics only when needed, or all the time. Doses are often higher than normal. - Inhaled medicines to help open the airways. - Other medicines that are given by a breathing treatment to thin mucus and make it easier to cough up are DNAse enzyme. therapy and highly concentrated salt solutions (hypertonic saline). - Flu vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) yearly (ask your health care provider). - Lung transplant is an option in some cases. - Oxygen therapy may be needed as lung disease gets worse. Lung problems are also treated with therapies to thin the mucus. This makes it easier to cough the mucus out of the lungs. These methods include: - Activity or exercise that causes you to breathe deeply - Devices that are used during the day to help clear the airways of too much mucus - Manual chest percussion (or chest physiotherapy), in which a family member or a therapist lightly claps the person&aposs chest, back, and area under the arms Treatment for bowel and nutritional problems may include: - A special diet high in protein and calories for older children and adults - Pancreatic enzymes to help absorb fats and protein, which are taken with every meal - Vitamin supplements, especially vitamins A, D, E, and K - Your provider can advise other treatments if you have very hard stools Ivacaftor is a medicine that treats certain types of CF. It improves the function of one of the defective genes that causes CF. As a result, there is less buildup of thick mucus in the lungs. Other CF symptoms are improved as well. Care and monitoring at home should include: - Avoiding smoke, dust, dirt, fumes, household chemicals, fireplace smoke, and mold or mildew. - Giving plenty of fluids, especially to infants and children in hot weather, when there is diarrhea or loose stools, or during extra physical activity. - Exercising 2 or 3 times each week. Swimming, jogging, and cycling are good options. - Clearing or bringing up mucus or secretions from the airways. This must be done 1 to 4 times each day. Patients, families, and caregivers must learn about doing chest percussion and postural drainage to help keep the airways clear. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cystic fibrosis support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help your family to not feel alone. Most children with CF stay in good health until they reach adulthood. They are able to take part in most activities and attend school. Many young adults with CF finish college or find jobs. Lung disease eventually worsens to the point where the person is disabled. Today, the average life span for people with CF who live to adulthood is about 37 years. Death is most often caused by lung complications. The most common complication is chronic respiratory infection. Other complications include: - Bowel problems, such as gallstones, intestinal blockage, and rectal prolapse - Coughing up blood - Chronic respiratory failure - Diabetes - Infertility - Liver disease or liver failure, pancreatitis, biliary cirrhosis - Malnutrition - Nasal polyps and sinusitis - Osteoporosis and arthritis - Pneumonia that keeps coming back - Pneumothorax - Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale) Call your provider if an infant or child has symptoms of CF, and experiences: - Fever, increased coughing, changes in sputum or blood in sputum, loss of appetite, or other signs of pneumonia - Increased weight loss - More frequent bowel movements or stools that are foul-smelling or have more mucus - Swollen belly or increased bloating Call your provider if a person with CF develops new symptoms or if symptoms get worse, particularly severe breathing difficulty or coughing up blood. CF cannot be prevented. Screening those with a family history of the disease may detect the CF gene in many carriers. Updated by: Neil K.

-0.375	how common is cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes mucus to build up and clog some of the organs in the body, particularly in the lungs and pancreas. Symptoms may include very  males,  infertility. Over time, mucus buildup and infections can lead to permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. [1] [2] [3] Treatment depends on the symptoms, and usually includes respiratory therapies, inhaled medicines,  pancreatic enzyme supplement, nutritional supplements, and others. Newer medication such as  CFTR modulators have been approved for use in United States. Ongoing research is focused on finding the cure for the disease. [2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Biliary cirrhosis Very frequent Decreased antibody level in blood Very frequent Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency Very frequent Immunodeficiency Very frequent Malabsorption Very frequent Pulmonary fibrosis Very frequent Recurrent respiratory infections Very frequent Dehydration Occasional Hepatomegaly Occasional Asthma - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bronchiectasis - Chronic lung disease - Cor pulmonale - Elevated sweat chloride - Failure to thrive - Hypercalciuria - Male infertility - Meconium ileus - Rectal prolapse - Recurrent bronchopulmonary infections - Recurrent pneumonia - View complete list of signs and symptoms... Mutations in a gene  called  cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cause CF. More than 900 mutations in this gene have been found. This gene provides the instructions for the CFTR protein . In normal cells , the CFTR protein acts as a channel that allows cells to release chloride and other ions. But in people with CF, this protein is defective and the cells do not release the chloride. The result is an improper salt balance in the cells which leads to thick, sticky mucus. [3]  CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [4] [1] [5] This means that to have the genetic disorder, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the CFTR gene in each cell . People with CF inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to have CF 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier of CF like each parent 25% chance to not have CF and not be a carrier CF When a carrier of CF has a child with a person with CF, each child has a: 50% (1 in 2) chance to have CF 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier of CF A helpful diagram/pictures of both of these situations can be found on the Carrier Testing for CF page of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation website. CFTR is the only gene known to be associated with cystic fibrosis. Reasons for genetic testing or screening of this gene may include: [4] Diagnosis in individuals with symptoms of CF or with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) Prenatal diagnosis of a fetus at risk Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and their reproductive partners or for  population screening Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for pregnancies at high risk for CF More information about genetic testing for cystic fibrosis is available on The National Human Genome Research Institute’s Web site and can be viewed by clicking here.

-0.75	how common is cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (Symptoms): Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it&aposs important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) - Wheezing - Breathlessness - Exercise intolerance - Repeated lung infections - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren&apost able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools - Poor weight gain and growth - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing.
-0.875	how common is cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (Complications): - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes). - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps). - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood. - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness. - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can&apost absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins. - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30. - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones. - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion. - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it&aposs possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure.
2.0	how common is fragile x syndrome	Fragile X Syndrome: The genetic disorder Fragile X syndrome, which results from mutations in a gene on the X chromosome, is the most commonly inherited form of developmental and intellectual disability. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.  What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person’s development, especially that person’s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? » Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats—repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the “size of the mutation,” affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. «  Condition Information What causes it? » Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body’s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female’s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. «  How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected? » About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. «  What causes it? What are common symptoms » People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don’t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people’s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. «  How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed? » Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. «  What are common symptoms? What are the treatments? » ​​ There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child’s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. « How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments » Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn’t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don’t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations. [top] « What are the Treatments?
-0.166666666667	how common is fragile x syndrome	What is fragile X syndrome?: Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Usually, males are more severely affected by this disorder than females. Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age 2. Most males with fragile X syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while about one-third of affected females are intellectually disabled. Children with fragile X syndrome may also have anxiety and hyperactive behavior such as fidgeting or impulsive actions. They may have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which includes an impaired ability to maintain attention and difficulty focusing on specific tasks. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction. Seizures occur in about 15 percent of males and about 5 percent of females with fragile X syndrome. Most males and about half of females with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that become more apparent with age. These features include a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after puberty.

Some, such as Alzheimer’s disease or Huntington’s disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing.
0.625	how do i prevent myself from having dementia	Dementia: Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness.  Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain’s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.  Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer’s disease and some other progressive dementias are now available.  Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individual’s quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home. Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia.  Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning. For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking. There are many disorders that can cause dementia. Some, such as Alzheimer’s disease or Huntington’s disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing.
0.75	how do i prevent myself from having dementia	Dementia (Treatment): Most types of dementia can&apost be cured, but there are ways to manage your symptoms. Medications The following are used to temporarily improve dementia symptoms. - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer&aposs disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson&aposs disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. A common side effect of memantine is dizziness. - Other medications. Your doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances or agitation. Therapies Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia.
0.5	how do i prevent myself from having dementia	Dementia (WHAT IS VASCULAR DEMENTIA?): Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer&aposs disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer&aposs, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one&aposs lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer&aposs disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger&aposs disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the "network" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger&aposs are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA&aposs list of resources.
-0.875	how do i prevent myself from having dementia	Dementia: Dementia isn&apost a specific disease. Instead, dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Though dementia generally involves memory loss, memory loss has different causes. So memory loss alone doesn&apost mean you have dementia. Alzheimer&aposs disease is the most common cause of a progressive dementia in older adults, but there are a number of causes of dementia. Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms can be reversed. Dementia care at Mayo Clinic Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause, but common signs and symptoms include: Cognitive changes - Memory loss, which is usually noticed by a spouse or someone else - Difficulty communicating or finding words - Difficulty reasoning or problem-solving - Difficulty handling complex tasks - Difficulty with planning and organizing - Difficulty with coordination and motor functions - Confusion and disorientation Psychological changes - Personality changes - Depression - Anxiety - Inappropriate behavior - Paranoia - Agitation - Hallucinations When to see a doctor See a doctor if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms. Some treatable medical conditions can cause dementia symptoms, so it&aposs important to determine the underlying cause. Dementia involves damage of nerve cells in the brain, which can occur in several areas of the brain. Dementia affects people differently, depending on the area of the brain affected. Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common, such as the part of the brain that&aposs affected or whether they worsen over time (progressive dementias). Some dementias, such as those caused by a reaction to medications or vitamin deficiencies, might improve with treatment. Progressive dementias Types of dementias that progress and aren&apost reversible include: - Alzheimer&aposs disease. In people age 65 and older, Alzheimer&aposs disease is the most common cause of dementia. Although the cause of Alzheimer&aposs disease isn&apost known, plaques and tangles are often found in the brains of people with Alzheimer&aposs. Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid, and tangles are fibrous tangles made up of tau protein. Certain genetic factors might make it more likely that people will develop Alzheimer&aposs. - Vascular dementia. This second most common type of dementia occurs as a result of damage to the vessels that supply blood to your brain. Blood vessel problems can be caused by stroke or other blood vessel conditions. - Lewy body dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein that have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer&aposs disease and Parkinson&aposs disease. This is one of the more common types of progressive dementia. - Frontotemporal dementia. This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, the areas generally associated with personality, behavior and language. As with other dementias, the cause isn&apost known. - Mixed dementia. Autopsy studies of the brains of people 80 and older who had dementia indicate that many had a combination of Alzheimer&aposs disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments. Other disorders linked to dementia - Huntington&aposs disease. Caused by a genetic mutation, this disease causes certain nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord to waste away. Signs and symptoms, including a severe decline in thinking (cognitive) skills usually appear around age 30 or 40. - Traumatic brain injury. This condition is caused by repetitive head trauma, such as experienced by boxers, football players or soldiers. Depending on the part of the brain that&aposs injured, this condition can cause dementia signs and symptoms, such as depression, explosiveness, memory loss, uncoordinated movement and impaired speech, as well as slow movement, tremors and rigidity (parkinsonism). Symptoms might not appear until years after the trauma. - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors. This condition might be due to an abnormal form of a protein. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be inherited or caused by exposure to diseased brain or nervous system tissue. Signs and symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear around age 60. - Parkinson&aposs disease. Many people with Parkinson&aposs disease eventually develop dementia symptoms (Parkinson&aposs disease dementia). Dementia-like conditions that can be reversed Some causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms can be reversed with treatment. They include: - Infections and immune disorders. Dementia-like symptoms can result from fever or other side effects of your body&aposs attempt to fight off an infection. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis that result from the body&aposs immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia. - Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. People with thyroid problems, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), too little or too much sodium or calcium, or an impaired ability to absorb vitamin B-12 can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes. - Nutritional deficiencies. Not drinking enough liquids (dehydration); not getting enough thiamin (vitamin B-1), which is common in people with chronic alcoholism; and not getting enough vitamins B-6 and B-12 in your diet can cause dementia-like symptoms. - Reactions to medications. A reaction to a medication or an interaction of several medications can cause dementia-like symptoms. - Subdural hematomas. Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the covering over the brain, which is common in the elderly after a fall, can cause symptoms similar to dementia. - Poisoning. Exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, and other poisons, such as pesticides, as well as alcohol abuse or recreational drug use can lead to symptoms of dementia. Symptoms might resolve with treatment. - Brain tumors. Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor. - Anoxia. This condition, also called hypoxia, occurs when organ tissues aren&apost getting enough oxygen. Anoxia can occur due to severe asthma, heart attack, carbon monoxide poisoning or other causes. - Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This condition, which is caused by enlarged ventricles in the brain, can cause walking problems, urinary difficulty and memory loss. Many factors can eventually lead to dementia. Some factors, such as age, can&apost be changed. Others can be addressed to reduce your risk. Risk factors that can&apost be changed - Age. The risk rises as you age, especially after age 65. However, dementia isn&apost a normal part of aging, and dementia can occur in younger people. - Family history. Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. Tests to determine whether you have certain genetic mutations are available. - Down syndrome. By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. - Mild cognitive impairment. This involves difficulties with memory but without loss of daily function. It puts people at higher risk of dementia. Risk factors you can change You might be able to control the following risk factors of dementia. - Heavy alcohol use. If you drink large amounts of alcohol, you might have a higher risk of dementia. Some studies, however, have shown that moderate amounts of alcohol might have a protective effect. - Cardiovascular risk factors. These include high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, buildup of fats in your artery walls (atherosclerosis) and obesity. - Depression. Although not yet well-understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia. - Diabetes. If you have diabetes, you might have an increased risk of dementia, especially if it&aposs poorly controlled. - Smoking. Smoking might increase your risk of developing dementia and blood vessel (vascular) diseases. - Sleep apnea. People who snore and have episodes where they frequently stop breathing while asleep may have reversible memory loss. Dementia can affect many body systems and, therefore, the ability to function. Dementia can lead to: - Inadequate nutrition. Many people with dementia eventually reduce or stop their intake of nutrients. Ultimately, they may be unable to chew and swallow. - Pneumonia. Difficulty swallowing increases the risk of choking or aspirating food into the lungs, which can block breathing and cause pneumonia. - Inability to perform self-care tasks. As dementia progresses, it can interfere with bathing, dressing, brushing hair or teeth, using the toilet independently and taking medications accurately. - Personal safety challenges. Some day-to-day situations can present safety issues for people with dementia, including driving, cooking and walking alone. - Death. Late-stage dementia results in coma and death, often from infection. Diagnosing dementia and determining what type it is can be challenging. A diagnosis of dementia requires that at least two core mental functions be impaired enough to interfere with daily living. They are memory, language skills, ability to focus and pay attention, ability to reason and problem-solve, and visual perception. Your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms and conduct a physical examination. He or she will likely ask someone close to you about your symptoms, as well. No single test can diagnose dementia, so doctors are likely to run a number of tests that can help pinpoint the problem. Cognitive and neuropsychological tests Doctors will evaluate your thinking (cognitive) function. A number of tests measure thinking skills such as memory, orientation, reasoning and judgment, language skills, and attention. Neurological evaluation Doctors evaluate your memory, language, visual perception, attention, problem-solving, movement, senses, balance, reflexes and other areas. Brain scans - CT or MRI. These scans can check for evidence of stroke or bleeding or tumor or hydrocephalus. - PET scans. These can show patterns of brain activity and if the amyloid protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer&aposs disease, has been deposited in the brain. Laboratory tests Simple blood tests can detect physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. Sometimes the spinal fluid is examined for infection, inflammation or markers of some degenerative diseases. Psychiatric evaluation A mental health professional can determine whether depression or another mental health condition is contributing to your symptoms. Most types of dementia can&apost be cured, but there are ways to manage your symptoms. Medications The following are used to temporarily improve dementia symptoms. - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer&aposs disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson&aposs disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. A common side effect of memantine is dizziness. - Other medications. Your doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances or agitation. Therapies Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia. Dementia symptoms and behavior problems will progress over time. Caregivers might try the following suggestions: - Enhance communication. When talking with your loved one, maintain eye contact. Speak slowly in simple sentences, and don&apost rush the response. Present one idea or instruction at a time. Use gestures and cues, such as pointing to objects. - Encourage exercise. Exercise benefits everyone, including people with dementia. The main benefits of exercise include improved strength and cardiovascular health. There is growing evidence that exercise also protects the brain from dementia, especially when combined with a healthy diet and treatment for risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Some research also shows physical activity might slow the progression of impaired thinking in people with Alzheimer&aposs disease. And it can lessen symptoms of depression. - Encourage activity. Plan activities the person with dementia enjoys and can do. Dancing, painting, gardening, cooking, singing and others can be fun, can help you connect with your loved one, and can help your loved one focus on what he or she can still do. - Establish a nighttime ritual. Behavior is often worse at night. Try to establish going-to-bed rituals that are calming and away from the noise of television, meal cleanup and active family members. Leave nightlights on in the bedroom, hall and bathroom to prevent disorientation. Limiting caffeine, discouraging napping and offering opportunities for exercise during the day might ease nighttime restlessness. - Encourage keeping a calendar. A calendar might help your loved one remember upcoming events, daily activities and medication schedules. Consider sharing a calendar with your loved one. - Plan for the future. Develop a plan with your loved one while he or she is able to participate that identifies goals for future care. Support groups, legal advisers, family members and others might be able to help. You&aposll need to consider financial and legal issues, safety and daily living concerns, and long-term care options. Several dietary supplements, herbal remedies and therapies have been studied for people with dementia. Some may be beneficial. Use caution when considering taking dietary supplements, vitamins or herbal remedies, especially if you&aposre taking other medications. These remedies aren&apost regulated, and claims about their benefits aren&apost always based on scientific research. Some alternative medicines for Alzheimer&aposs disease and other forms of dementia that have been studied include: - Vitamin E. Evidence for taking vitamin E to slow Alzheimer disease is soft. Doctors warn against taking large doses of vitamin E because it may have a higher risk of mortality, especially in people with heart disease. - Omega-3 fatty acids. There is some evidence that eating fish three times a week might lower your risk of dementia. However, in clinical studies, omega-3 fatty acids haven&apost significantly slowed cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer&aposs disease. More research is needed. - Ginkgo. Although ginkgo is considered safe, study results have been inconsistent in determining whether ginkgo helps people with dementia. The following techniques may help reduce agitation and promote relaxation in people with dementia. - Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music - Pet therapy, which involves use of animals, such as visits from dogs, to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia - Aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils - Massage therapy - Art therapy, which involves creating art, focusing on the process rather than the outcome Other therapies The following techniques may help reduce agitation and promote relaxation in people with dementia. - Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music - Pet therapy, which involves use of animals, such as visits from dogs, to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia - Aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils - Massage therapy - Art therapy, which involves creating art, focusing on the process rather than the outcome
1.875	how do i stop using rasagiline	Rasagiline: Rasagiline is used alone or in combination with another medication to treat the symptoms of Parkinson&aposs disease (a slowly progressing disease of the nervous system causing a fixed face without expression, tremor at rest, slowing of movements, walking with shuffling steps, stooped posture and muscle weakness). Rasagiline is in a class of medications called monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain. Rasagiline comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take rasagiline at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rasagiline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of rasagiline and may increase your dose based upon your body&aposs response to this medication. Do not stop taking rasagiline without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking rasagiline, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as a fever; muscle stiffness; unsteadiness, wobbliness, or lack of coordination; or changes in consciousness. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of rasagiline is decreased. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking rasagiline, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to rasagiline, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in rasagiline tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients. - tell your doctor if you are taking cough and cold products containing dextromethorphan (DM; Delsym, Hold, Robitussin CoughGels, Vicks 44 Cough Relief, in Robitussin DM, others), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), meperidine (Demerol), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), propoxyphene (Darvon, in Darvocet-N, others), St. John&aposs wort, or tramadol (Ultram, in Ultracet). Also tell your doctor if you are taking MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) or have stopped taking them within the past two weeks. Your doctor may tell you not to take rasagiline if you are taking one or more of these medications. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: amphetamines (Adderall, Dexedrine, DextroStat); antidepressants; cimetidine (Tagamet); decongestants placed in the eye or nose; diet or weight-control products containing ephedrine; fluoroquinolone antibiotics including ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gatifloxacin (Tequin), levofloxacin (Levaquin), norfloxacin (Noroxin), and ofloxacin (Floxin); fluvoxamine (Luvox); medications to treat asthma; medications to treat high blood pressure; medications to treat mental illness; medications to treat pain; phenylpropanolamine (not available in the U.S.); pseudoephedrine (PediaCare, Sudafed, Suphedrine, others); and ticlopidine (Ticlid). Tell your doctor if you are taking fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) or have stopped taking it within the past 5 weeks. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, mental illness or psychosis;kidney, or liver disease. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking rasagiline, call your doctor. - you should know that rasagiline may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common during the first 2 months of taking rasagiline. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up. - you should know that rasagiline may cause serious, life-threatening high blood pressure when taken with certain medications or foods. Carefully follow your doctor&aposs instructions about medications and foods to be avoided. Call your doctor right away if you have a severe headache, blurred vision, or any of the other symptoms listed below as serious side effects. - you should know that people who have Parkinson&aposs disease have a higher risk of melanoma (a type of skin cancer) than people who do not have Parkinson&aposs disease. It is not known whether this increased risk is caused by Parkinson&aposs disease, medications used for Parkinson&aposs disease such as rasagiline, or other factors. You should have regular visits with a dermatologist to examine your skin for melanoma. - you should know that some people who took rasagiline or similar medications to treat Parkinson&aposs disease experienced intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other urges that they were unable to control. Tell your doctor if you experience new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking rasagiline. You will need to avoid eating foods that contain very high amounts of tyramine, such as aged cheeses (e.g., Stilton or blue cheese) during your treatment with rasagiline. Talk to your doctor or dietitian about which foods you should avoid during your treatment or if you do not feel well after eating or drinking certain foods while taking rasagiline. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time the next day. Rasagiline may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - mild headache - joint or neck pain - heartburn - nausea - vomiting - stomach pain - constipation - diarrhea - loss of appetite - weight loss - flu-like symptoms - fever - sweating - red, swollen, and/or itchy eyes - dry mouth - swollen gums - unsteadiness, wobbliness, or lack of coordination - involuntary, repeated body movements - lack of energy - sleepiness - abnormal dreams - depression - pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet - rash - bruising or purple discoloration on skin Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - severe headache - blurred vision - seizures - chest pain - shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - confusion - unconsciousness - slow or difficult speech - dizziness or faintness - weakness or numbness of an arm or leg - hallucinating (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist) - extreme restlessness - difficulty thinking clearly or understanding reality Rasagiline may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA&aposs Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Symptoms of rasagiline overdose may occur as late as 1 to 2 days after the overdose. Symptoms of overdose may include the following: - drowsiness - dizziness - faintness - irritability - hyperactivity - agitation or restlessness - severe headache - hallucinating - confusion - loss of coordination - difficulty opening the mouth - rigid body spasm that may include an arched back - twitching muscles - seizures - loss of consciousness - fast or irregular heart beat - pain in the area between the stomach and chest - difficulty breathing or slowed breathing - diarrhea - fever - sweating - cool, clammy skin - shivering - increase in pupil size (black circle in middle of eye) Keep all appointments with your doctor. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies. - Azilect®

Drug abuse in children and teenagers may pose a greater hazard than in older people. This is because their brains are not yet fully developed. As a result, the brains of young people may be more susceptible to drug abuse and addiction than adult brains. Abused drugs include - Amphetamines - Anabolic steroids - Club drugs - Cocaine - Heroin - Inhalants - Marijuana - Prescription drugs There are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But it is better to prevent drug abuse in the first place. NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse

-0.571428571429	how do people get diabetes	Diabetes and nerve damage (Causes): In people with diabetes, the body&aposs nerves can be damaged by decreased blood flow and a high blood sugar level. This condition is more likely when the blood sugar level is not well controlled. About one half of people with diabetes develop nerve damage. Symptoms often do not begin until many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Some people who have diabetes that develops slowly already have nerve damage when they are first diagnosed. People with diabetes are also at higher risk for other nerve problems not caused by their diabetes. These other nerve problems won&apost have the same symptoms and will progress in a different manner than nerve damage caused by diabetes.
2.0	how do people get diabetes	Diabetes (Causes): Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn&apost use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.
-0.142857142857	how do people get diabetes	Diabetes (Symptoms): A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including: - Blurry vision - Excess thirst - Fatigue - Frequent urination - Hunger - Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed. After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include: - Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, and blindness - Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot - Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction - Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure - Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections - Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke
-0.285714285714	how do people get diabetes	Diabetes - tests and checkups (Eye Exams): An eye doctor should check your eyes every year. See an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes. If you have eye problems because of diabetes, you will probably see your eye doctor more often.
-0.714285714286	how do people get diabetes	Diabetes - keeping active (Health Risks): There are some health risks to beginning new activity programs. Always check with your provider before getting started. People with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems. They DO NOT always sense the warning signs of a heart attack. Ask your doctor if you need to be screened for heart disease, especially if you: - Also have high blood pressure - Also have high cholesterol - Smoke - Have a history of heart disease in your family People with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems. Talk to your provider if you have had joint pain with activity in the past. Some people who are obese may develop skin rashes when they start new exercises. People with diabetes and nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities. Check your feet daily for redness, blisters, or calluses that are starting to form. Always wear socks. Check your socks and shoes for rough spots, which can cause blisters or ulcers. Make sure your toenails are trimmed. Some types of vigorous exercise can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.
0.666666666667	how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?	Burns (Treatment): Treatment of burns depends on the type and extent of the injuries. Most minor burns can be treated at home using over-the-counter products or aloe. They usually heal within a few weeks. For serious burns, after appropriate first aid care and wound assessment, your treatment may involve medications, wound dressings, therapy and surgery. The goals of treatment are to control pain, remove dead tissue, prevent infection, reduce scarring, regain function and address emotional needs. You may need months of additional treatments and therapy. This may be done during a hospital stay, on an outpatient basis or at home. Factors affecting this choice include your wishes, other conditions and abilities, such as whether you&aposre able to change bandages. Medications and wound healing products For major burns, various medications and products are used to encourage healing. - Water-based treatments. Your care team may use techniques such as ultrasound mist therapy to clean and stimulate the wound tissue. - Fluids to prevent dehydration. You may need intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent dehydration and organ failure. - Pain and anxiety medications. Healing burns can be incredibly painful. You may need morphine and anti-anxiety medications - particularly for dressing changes. - Burn creams and ointments. Your care team can select from a variety of topical products for wound healing. These help keep the wound moist, reduce pain, prevent infection and speed healing. - Dressings. Your care team may also use various specialty wound dressings. These create a moist environment that fights infection and helps the burn heal. - Drugs that fight infection. If you develop an infection, you may need IV antibiotics. - Tetanus shot. Your doctor might recommend a tetanus shot after a burn injury. Physical and occupational therapy If the burned area is large, especially if it covers any joints, you may need physical therapy exercises. These can help stretch the skin so the joints can remain flexible. Other types of exercises can improve muscle strength and coordination. And occupational therapy may help if you have difficulty doing your normal daily activities. Surgical and other procedures You may need one or more of the following procedures: - Breathing assistance. If you&aposve been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut. If that appears likely, your doctor may insert a tube down your windpipe (trachea) to keep oxygen supplied to your lungs. - Tube feeding. Your metabolism goes into overdrive when your body starts trying to heal your burns. To provide adequate nutrition for this task, you doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach. - Easing blood flow around the wound. If a burn scab (eschar) goes completely around a limb, it can tighten and cut off the blood circulation. A scab (eschar) that goes completely around the chest can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor may cut the eschar in several places to relieve this pressure. This procedure is called decompression. - Skin grafts. A skin graft is a surgical procedure in which sections of your own healthy skin are used to replace the scar tissue caused by deep burns. Donor skin from cadavers or pigs can be used as a temporary solution. - Plastic surgery. Plastic surgery (reconstruction) can improve the appearance of burn scars and increase the flexibility of joints affected by scarring.
0.555555555556	how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?	What to do for Radiation sickness?: Radiation sickness results when humans (or other animals) are exposed to very large doses of ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure can occur as a single large exposure (acute), or a series of small exposures spread over time (chronic). Exposure may be accidental or intentional (as in radiation therapy). Radiation sickness is generally associated with acute exposure and has a characteristic set of symptoms that appear in an orderly fashion. Chronic exposure is usually associated with delayed medical problems such as cancer and premature aging, which may happen over a long period of time. The risk of cancer depends on the dose and begins to build up, even with very low doses. There is no "minimum threshold". Exposure from x-rays or gamma rays is measured in units of roentgens. For example: - Total body exposure of 100 roentgens/rad or 1 Gray unit (Gy) causes radiation sickness. - Total body exposure of 400 roentgens/rad (or 4 Gy) causes radiation sickness and death in half of the individuals who are exposed. Without medical treatment, nearly everyone who receives more than this amount of radiation will die within 30 days. - 100,000 roentgens/rad (1,000 Gy) causes almost immediate unconsciousness and death within an hour. The severity of symptoms and illness (acute radiation sickness) depends on the type and amount of radiation, how long you were exposed, and which part of the body was exposed. Symptoms of radiation sickness may occur immediately after exposure, or over the next few days, weeks, or months. Bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract are especially sensitive to radiation injury. Children and babies still in the womb are more likely to be severely injured by radiation. Because it is difficult to determine the amount of radiation exposure from nuclear accidents, the best signs of the severity of the exposure are: the length of time between the exposure and the onset of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and severity of changes in white blood cells. If a person vomits less than an hour after being exposed, that usually means the radiation dose received is very high and death may be expected. Children who receive radiation treatments or who are accidentally exposed to radiation will be treated based on their symptoms and their blood cell counts. Frequent blood studies are necessary and require a small puncture through the skin into a vein to obtain blood samples.
0.888888888889	how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?	What to do for Radiation sickness?: Unfortunately, giving first aid to radiation victims may expose rescue personnel to radiation unless they are properly protected. Victims must be decontaminated as part of the resuscitation process so that they do not cause radiation injury to others. This may complicate the first aid and resuscitation process. - Check the person&aposs breathing and pulse. - Start CPR, if necessary. - Remove the person&aposs clothing and place the items in a sealed container. This stops ongoing contamination. - Vigorously wash the victim with soap and water. - Dry the victim and wrap with a soft, clean blanket. - Call for emergency medical help or take the person to nearest emergency medical facility if you can do so safely - REPORT EXPOSURE TO EMERGENCY OFFICIALS. If symptoms occur during or after medical radiation treatments: - Tell the provider or seek medical treatment. - Handle affected areas gently. - Treat symptoms or illnesses as recommended by the provider.

Burns (Causes): Many things can cause burns, including: - Fire - Hot liquid or steam - Hot metal, glass or other objects - Electrical currents - Radiation from X-rays or radiation therapy to treat cancer - Sunlight or ultraviolet light from a sunlamp or tanning bed - Chemicals such as strong acids, lye, paint thinner or gasoline - Abuse
0.777777777778	how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?	Burns (Summary): Summary A burn is damage to your body&aposs tissues caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, sunlight, or radiation. Scalds from hot liquids and steam, building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury, caused by breathing smoke. There are three types of burns: - First-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin - Second-degree burns damage the outer layer and the layer underneath - Third-degree burns damage or destroy the deepest layer of skin and tissues underneath Burns can cause swelling, blistering, scarring and, in serious cases, shock, and even death. They also can lead to infections because they damage your skin&aposs protective barrier. Treatment for burns depends on the cause of the burn, how deep it is, and how much of the body it covers. Antibiotic creams can prevent or treat infections. For more serious burns, treatment may be needed to clean the wound, replace the skin, and make sure the patient has enough fluids and nutrition.

-0.777777777778	how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?	Burns (Symptoms): Burns don&apost affect the skin uniformly, so a single injury can reach varying depths. Distinguishing a minor burn from a more serious burn involves determining the extent of tissue damage. The following are three classifications of burns: - First-degree burn. This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It may cause redness, swelling and pain. It usually heals with first-aid measures within several days to a week. Sunburn is a classic example. - Second-degree burn. This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin (dermis). It may cause red, white or splotchy skin, pain, and swelling. And the wound often looks wet or moist. Blisters may develop, and pain can be severe. Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring. - Third-degree burn. This burn reaches into the fat layer beneath the skin. Burned areas may be charred black or white. The skin may look waxy or leathery. Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, causing numbness. A person with this type of burn may also have difficulty breathing or experience smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide poisoning. When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical assistance for: - Burns that cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, a major joint or a large area of the body - Deep burns, which means burns affecting all layers of the skin and even other tissues - Burns caused by chemicals or electricity - Difficulty breathing or burns to the airway Minor burns can be cared for at home, but call your doctor if you experience: - Large blisters - Signs of infection, such as oozing from the wound, increased pain, redness and swelling - A burn or blister that doesn&apost heal in several weeks - New, unexplained symptoms - Significant scarring

-0.888888888889	how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?	Burns (Complications): Deep or widespread burns can lead to many complications, including: - Infection. Burns can leave skin vulnerable to bacterial infection and increase your risk of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening infection that travels through the bloodstream and affects your whole body. It progresses rapidly and can cause shock and organ failure. - Low blood volume. Burns can damage blood vessels and cause fluid loss. This may result in low blood volume (hypovolemia). Severe blood and fluid loss prevents the heart from pumping enough blood to the body. - Dangerously low body temperature. The skin helps control the body&aposs temperature, so when a large portion of the skin is injured, you lose body heat. This increases your risk of a dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia). Hypothermia is a condition in which the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat. - Breathing problems. Breathing hot air or smoke can burn airways and cause breathing (respiratory) difficulties. Smoke inhalation damages the lungs and can cause respiratory failure. - Scarring. Burns can cause scars and ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids). - Bone and joint problems. Deep burns can limit movement of the bones and joints. Scar tissue can form and cause shortening and tightening of skin, muscles or tendons (contractures). This condition may permanently pull joints out of position.

The hepatitis A virus is found mostly in the stool and blood of an infected person. The virus is present about 15 to 45 days before symptoms occur and during the first week of illness. You can catch hepatitis A if: - You eat or drink food or water that has been contaminated by stools (feces) containing the hepatitis A virus. Unpeeled and uncooked fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease. - You come in contact with the stool or blood of a person who currently has the disease. - A person with hepatitis A passes the virus to an object or food due to poor hand-washing after using the toilet. - You take part in sexual practices that involve oral-anal contact. Not everyone has symptoms with hepatitis A infection. Therefore, many more people are infected than are diagnosed or reported. Risk factors include: - Overseas travel, especially to Asia, South or Central America, Africa and the Middle East  - IV drug use - Living in a nursing home center - Working in a health care, food, or sewage industry Other common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatitis A is the least serious and mildest of these diseases. Symptoms most often show up 2 to 6 weeks after being exposed to the hepatitis A virus. They are most often mild, but may last for up to several months, especially in adults. Symptoms include: - Dark urine - Fatigue - Itching - Loss of appetite - Low-grade fever - Nausea and vomiting - Pale or clay-colored stools - Yellow skin (jaundice) The health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may show that your liver is enlarged and tender. Blood tests may show: - Raised IgM and IgG antibodies to hepatitis A (IgM is usually positive before IgG) - Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests), especially transaminase enzyme levels There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. - You should rest and stay well hydrated when the symptoms are the worst. - People with acute hepatitis should avoid alcohol and drugs that are toxic to the liver, including acetaminophen (Tylenol) during the acute illness and for several months after recovery. - Fatty foods may cause vomiting and are best avoided during the acute phase of the illness. The virus does not remain in the body after the infection is gone. Most people with hepatitis A recover within 3 months. Nearly all people get better within 6 months. There is no lasting damage once you&aposve recovered. Also, you can&apost get the disease again. There is a low risk of death. The risk is higher among older adults and people with long-term liver disease.  Call your provider if you have symptoms of hepatitis. The following tips can help reduce your risk of spreading or catching the virus: - Always wash your hands well after using the restroom, and when you come in contact with an infected person&aposs blood, stools, or other bodily fluid. - Avoid unclean food and water. The virus may spread more rapidly through day care centers and other places where people are in close contact. Thorough hand washing before and after each diaper change, before serving food, and after using the toilet may help prevent such outbreaks. Ask your provider about getting either immune globulin or the hepatitis A vaccine if you are exposed to the disease and have not had hepatitis A or the hepatitis A vaccine. Common reasons for getting one or both of these treatments include: - You have hepatitis B or C or any form of long-term liver disease. - You live with someone who has hepatitis A. - You recently had sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A. - You recently shared illegal drugs, either injected or noninjected, with someone who has hepatitis A. - You have had close personal contact over a period of time with someone who has hepatitis A. - You have eaten in a restaurant where food or food handlers were found to be infected or contaminated with hepatitis. - You are planning travel to where hepatitis A is common. Vaccines that protect against hepatitis A infection are available. The vaccine begins to protect 4 weeks after you get the first dose. You will need to get a booster shot 6 to 12 months later for long-term protection. Travelers should take the following steps to protect against getting the disease: - Avoid dairy products. - Avoid raw or undercooked meat and fish. - Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in unclean water. Travelers should peel all fresh fruits and vegetables themselves. - DO NOT buy food from street vendors. - Get vaccinated against hepatitis A (and possibly hepatitis B) if traveling to countries where outbreaks of the disease occur. - Use only carbonated bottled water for brushing teeth and drinking. (Remember that ice cubes can carry infection.) - If bottled water is not available, boiling water is the best way to get rid of hepatitis A. Bring the water to a full boil for at least 1 minute to make it safe to drink. - Heated food should be hot to the touch and eaten right away. Updated by: Michael M.

1.83333333333	how do you catch hepatitis c	What is Hepatitis C?: Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. One type, hepatitis C, is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It usually spreads through contact with infected blood. It can also spread through sex with an infected person and from mother to baby during childbirth. Most people who are infected with hepatitis C don&apost have any symptoms for years. If you do get symptoms, you may feel as if you have the flu. You may also have jaundice, a yellowing of skin and eyes, dark-colored urine, and pale bowel movements. A blood test can tell if you have it. Usually, hepatitis C does not get better by itself. The infection can last a lifetime and may lead to scarring of the liver or liver cancer. Medicines sometimes help, but side effects can be a problem. Serious cases may need a liver transplant. There is no vaccine for HCV. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
2.0	how do you catch hepatitis c	Hepatitis: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis, but the condition can also be caused by other infections, heavy alcohol use, toxins, certain medications, and autoimmune disease. There are five main virus types that cause hepatitis---type A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingesting contaminated food or water. Type B commonly occurs through contact with infected blood, semen or other bodily fluid through sex, sharing needles or other drug-injection equipment or from mother to baby at birth. Hepatitis type C is a blood-borne virus that is largely spread by sharing needles or other drug injection equipment. Hepatitis D, which is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, occurs only among people with hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B, C, and D afflict more than half a billion people worldwide and are responsible for more than a million deaths a year. Chronic infection with these viruses can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. The NIAID Hepatitis Research Program supports research on all hepatitis viruses. However, commensurate with the magnitude of the medical burdens imposed by these viruses, the greatest emphasis is placed on the study of hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses, which focuses on the understanding the pathogenesis and immunology of hepatitis viruses and developing novel therapeutics and vaccines against diseases caused by hepatitis viruses. Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver. Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements Stomach pain Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer. Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms.
1.66666666667	how do you catch hepatitis c	Hepatitis C (What is hepatitis C?): Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation and damage. Inflammation is swelling that occurs when tissues of the body become injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs.Viruses invade normal cells in your body. Many viruses cause infections that can be spread from person to person. The hepatitis C virus spreads through contact with an infected person’s blood.Hepatitis C can cause an acute or chronic infection.Although no vaccine for hepatitis C is available, you can take steps to protect yourself from hepatitis C. If you have hepatitis C, talk with your doctor about treatment. Medicines can cure most cases of hepatitis C.Acute hepatitis CAcute hepatitis C is a short-term infection. Symptoms can last up to 6 months. Sometimes your body is able to fight off the infection and the virus goes away.Chronic hepatitis CChronic hepatitis C is a long-lasting infection. Chronic hepatitis C occurs when your body isn’t able to fight off the virus. About 75 to 85 percent of people with acute hepatitis C will develop chronic hepatitis C.13Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis C can prevent liver damage. Without treatment, chronic hepatitis C can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.
-0.833333333333	how do you catch hepatitis c	Hepatitis virus panel: The hepatitis virus panel is a series of blood tests used to detect current or past infection by hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. It can screen blood samples for more than one kind of hepatitis virus at the same time. Antibody and antigen tests can detect each of the different hepatitis viruses. Note: Hepatitis D only causes disease in people who also have hepatitis B. It is not routinely checked on a hepatitis antibody panel. Blood is most often drawn from a vein the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood. Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed. The puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding. In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding. The blood sample is sent to a lab to be examined. Blood (serology) tests are used to check for antibodies to each of the hepatitis viruses. No special preparation is needed. Some people feel moderate pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, you may feel some throbbing. Your provider may order this test if you have signs of hepatitis. It is used to: - Detect current or previous hepatitis infection - Determine how contagious a person with hepatitis is - Monitor a person who is being treated for hepatitis The test may be performed for other conditions, such as: - Chronic persistent hepatitis - Hepatitis D (delta agent) - Nephrotic syndrome A normal result means no hepatitis antibodies are found in the blood sample. This is called a negative result. Normal value ranges may vary slightly depending on the lab doing the test. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. There are different tests for hepatitis A and B. A positive test is considered abnormal. A positive test may mean: - You currently have a hepatitis infection. This may be a new infection (acute hepatitis), or it may be an infection that you have had for a long time (chronic hepatitis). - You had a hepatitis infection in the past, but you no longer have the infection and can&apost spread it to others. Hepatitis A test results: - IgM anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibodies, you have had a recent infection with hepatitis A - Total (IgM and IgG) antibodies to hepatitis A, you have a previous or past infection, or immunity to hepatitis A Hepatitis B test results: - Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): you have an active hepatitis B infection, either recent or chronic (long-term) - Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (Anti-HBc), you have a recent or past hepatitis B infection - Antibody to HBsAg (Anti-HBs): you have a past hepatitis B infection or you have received the hepatitis B vaccine and are unlikely to become infected - Hepatitis B type e antigen (HBeAg): you have a chronic hepatitis B infection and you are more likely to spread the infection to others through sexual contact or by sharing needles Antibodies to hepatitis C can most often be detected 4 to 10 weeks after you get the infection. Other types of tests may be done to decide on treatment and monitor the hepatitis C infection. Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: - Excessive bleeding - Fainting or feeling lightheaded - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Updated by: Subodh K.

-0.571428571429	how do you check for lupus?	Lupus: Lupus is an autoimmune disease  that can affect almost every organ in the body. Symptoms of lupus can range from very mild to life-threatening. There are three main types of lupus; systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus, and drug-induced lupus. [1] Symptoms may include pain or swelling in joints, muscle pain, fever, red rashes, most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash"), hair loss, chest pain, sensitivity to the sun, swelling in legs or around the eyes, and feeling tired. [2] Genetics is thought to play a role in the development of lupus along with other lifestyle and environmental factors . Studies suggest that a number of different genes may be involved in determining a person’s likelihood of developing the disease, which tissues and organs are affected, and the severity of disease. Lupus is more common in young women. The treatment of lupus depends on the severity of the condition and what parts of the body are affected. Treatment may include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, antimalarial drugs, anti-inflammatory steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and other such as BLyS-specific inhibitors ( Belimumab). [1] You can read about the signs and symptoms of lupus from  MedlinePlus and the  National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Antinuclear antibody positivity - Antiphospholipid antibody positivity - Arthritis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cutaneous photosensitivity - Hemolytic anemia - Leukopenia - Nephritis - Pericarditis - Pleuritis - Psychosis - Seizures - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Thrombocytopenia - View complete list of signs and symptoms... The Lupus Foundation of American has a page called  Is lupus hereditary? that provides a good overview. They also have a Genetics page for all of their content tagged as related to genetics. Medscape Reference has an in-depth review of the genetics of lupus that was written for healthcare professionals but can be useful to anyone looking for detailed information. You may have to register to view the article, but registration is free.

0.571428571429	how do you check for lupus?	Lupus nephritis: Lupus nephritis is a kidney disorder which is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body&aposs immune system. Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues. SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead lead to disorders such as interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis. Over time, kidney failure can result. Symptoms of lupus nephritis include: - Blood in the urine - Foamy appearance to urine - High blood pressure - Swelling of any area of the body A physical exam shows signs of decreased kidney functioning with body swelling (edema). Blood pressure may be high. Abnormal sounds may be heard when the doctor listens to your heart and lungs. Tests that may be done include: - ANA titer - BUN and creatinine - Complement levels - Urinalysis - Urine protein - Kidney biopsy, to determine appropriate treatment The goal of treatment is to improve kidney function and to delay kidney failure. Medicines may include drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine. You may need dialysis to control symptoms of kidney failure, sometimes for only a while. A kidney transplant may be recommended. People with active lupus should not have a transplant because the condition can occur in the transplanted kidney. How well you do, depends on the specific form of lupus nephritis. You may have flare-ups, and then times when you do not have any symptoms. Some people with this condition develop chronic kidney failure. Although lupus nephritis may return in a transplanted kidney, it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease. Complications that may result from lupus nephritis include: - Acute renal failure - Chronic renal failure Call your health care provider if you have blood in the urine or swelling of your body. If you have lupus nephritis, call your provider if you notice decreased urine output. Treating lupus may help prevent or delay onset of lupus nephritis.

1.85714285714	how do you check for lupus?	Lupus: Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when your body&aposs immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments. The most distinctive sign of lupus - a facial rash that resembles the wings of a butterfly unfolding across both cheeks - occurs in many but not all cases of lupus. Some people are born with a tendency toward developing lupus, which may be triggered by infections, certain drugs or even sunlight. While there&aposs no cure for lupus, treatments can help control symptoms. No two cases of lupus are exactly alike. Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent. Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes - called flares - when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time. The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - Joint pain, stiffness and swelling - Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body - Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure (photosensitivity) - Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods (Raynaud&aposs phenomenon) - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Dry eyes - Headaches, confusion and memory loss When to see a doctor See your doctor if you develop an unexplained rash, ongoing fever, persistent aching or fatigue. Lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body (autoimmune disease). It&aposs likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment. It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include: - Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people. - Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people. - Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped. Factors that may increase your risk of lupus include: - Your sex. Lupus is more common in women. - Age. Although lupus affects people of all ages, it&aposs most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45. - Race. Lupus is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans. Diagnosing lupus is difficult because signs and symptoms vary considerably from person to person. Signs and symptoms of lupus may vary over time and overlap with those of many other disorders. No one test can diagnose lupus. The combination of blood and urine tests, signs and symptoms, and physical examination findings leads to the diagnosis. Laboratory tests Blood and urine tests may include: - Complete blood count. This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets as well as the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Results may indicate you have anemia, which commonly occurs in lupus. A low white blood cell or platelet count may occur in lupus as well. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This blood test determines the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in an hour. A faster than normal rate may indicate a systemic disease, such as lupus. The sedimentation rate isn&apost specific for any one disease. It may be elevated if you have lupus, an infection, another inflammatory condition or cancer. - Kidney and liver assessment. Blood tests can assess how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Lupus can affect these organs. - Urinalysis. An examination of a sample of your urine may show an increased protein level or red blood cells in the urine, which may occur if lupus has affected your kidneys. - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. A positive test for the presence of these antibodies - produced by your immune system - indicates a stimulated immune system. While most people with lupus have a positive ANA test, most people with a positive ANA do not have lupus. If you test positive for ANA, your doctor may advise more-specific antibody testing. Imaging tests If your doctor suspects that lupus is affecting your lungs or heart, he or she may suggest: - Chest X-ray. An image of your chest may reveal abnormal shadows that suggest fluid or inflammation in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your beating heart. It can check for problems with your valves and other portions of your heart. Biopsy Lupus can harm your kidneys in many different ways, and treatments can vary, depending on the type of damage that occurs. In some cases, it&aposs necessary to test a small sample of kidney tissue to determine what the best treatment might be. The sample can be obtained with a needle or through a small incision. Skin biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm a diagnosis of lupus affecting the skin. Treatment for lupus depends on your signs and symptoms. Determining whether your signs and symptoms should be treated and what medications to use requires a careful discussion of the benefits and risks with your doctor. As your signs and symptoms flare and subside, you and your doctor may find that you&aposll need to change medications or dosages. The medications most commonly used to control lupus include: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may be used to treat pain, swelling and fever associated with lupus. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach bleeding, kidney problems and an increased risk of heart problems. - Antimalarial drugs. Medications commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), affect the immune system and can help decrease the risk of lupus flares. Side effects can include stomach upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina of the eye. Regular eye exams are recommended when taking these medications. - Corticosteroids. Prednisone and other types of corticosteroids can counter the inflammation of lupus. High doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Medrol) are often used to control serious disease that involves the kidneys and brain. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones (osteoporosis), high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of infection. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses and longer term therapy. - Immunosuppressants. Drugs that suppress the immune system may be helpful in serious cases of lupus. Examples include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and methotrexate (Trexall). Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, decreased fertility and an increased risk of cancer. - Biologics. A different type of medication, belimumab (Benlysta) administered intravenously, also reduces lupus symptoms in some people. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea and infections. Rarely, worsening of depression can occur. - Rituximab (Rituxan) can be beneficial in cases of resistant lupus. Side effects include allergic reaction to the intravenous infusion and infections. Take steps to care for your body if you have lupus. Simple measures can help you prevent lupus flares and, should they occur, better cope with the signs and symptoms you experience. Try to: - See your doctor regularly. Having regular checkups instead of only seeing your doctor when your symptoms worsen may help your doctor prevent flare-ups, and can be useful in addressing routine health concerns, such as stress, diet and exercise that can be helpful in preventing lupus complications. - Be sun smart. Because ultraviolet light can trigger a flare, wear protective clothing - such as a hat, long-sleeved shirt and long pants - and use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 55 every time you go outside. - Get regular exercise. Exercise can help keep your bones strong, reduce your risk of heart attack and promote general well-being. - Don&apost smoke. Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and can worsen the effects of lupus on your heart and blood vessels. - Eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sometimes you may have dietary restrictions, especially if you have high blood pressure, kidney damage or gastrointestinal problems. - Ask your doctor if you need vitamin D and calcium supplements. There is some evidence to suggest that people with lupus may benefit from supplemental vitamin D. A 1,200- to 1,500-milligram calcium supplement taken daily may help keep your bones healthy. Sometimes people with lupus seek alternative or complementary medicine. However, there aren&apost any alternative therapies that have been shown to alter the course of lupus, although some may help ease symptoms of the disease. Discuss these treatments with your doctor before initiating them on your own. He or she can help you weigh the benefits and risks and tell you if the treatments will interfere adversely with your current lupus medications. Complementary and alternative treatments for lupus include: - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Supplements containing this hormone may help fatigue and muscle pain. It may lead to acne in women. - Fish oil. Fish oil supplements contain omega-3 fatty acids that may be beneficial for people with lupus. Preliminary studies have found some promise, though more study is needed. Side effects of fish oil supplements can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. - Acupuncture. This therapy uses tiny needles inserted just under the skin. It may help ease the muscle pain associated with lupus.
2.0	how do you diagnose anxiety	Anxiety (Diagnosis): You may start by seeing your primary care doctor to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. Your doctor can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment. However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy). To help diagnose an anxiety disorder and rule out other conditions, your provider may: - Give you a psychological evaluation. This involves describing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems - such as depression or substance abuse - which can make diagnosis more challenging. - Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5. Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder.
0.222222222222	how do you diagnose anxiety	What is Anxiety?: Fear and anxiety are part of life. You may feel anxious before you take a test or walk down a dark street. This kind of anxiety is useful - it can make you more alert or careful. It usually ends soon after you are out of the situation that caused it. But for millions of people in the United States, the anxiety does not go away, and gets worse over time. They may have chest pains or nightmares. They may even be afraid to leave home. These people have anxiety disorders. Types include - Panic disorder - Obsessive-compulsive disorder - Post-traumatic stress disorder - Phobias - Generalized anxiety disorder Treatment can involve medicines, therapy or both.

1.77777777778	how do you diagnose anxiety	Generalized anxiety disorder (Exams and Tests): There is no test that can make a diagnosis of GAD. The diagnosis is based on your answers to questions about the symptoms of GAD. Your health care provider will ask about these symptoms. You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health. A physical exam or lab tests may be done to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms.
1.55555555556	how do you diagnose anxiety	Anxiety: Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood. Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help. Anxiety care at Mayo Clinic Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: - Feeling nervous, restless or tense - Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom - Having an increased heart rate - Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) - Sweating - Trembling - Feeling weak or tired - Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry - Having trouble sleeping - Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems - Having difficulty controlling worry - Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: - Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. - Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. - Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events - even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. - Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they&aposve occurred. - Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. - Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that&aposs excessive for the child&aposs developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. - Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. - Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you&aposre exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. - Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of abusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. - Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don&apost meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor See your doctor if: - You feel like you&aposre worrying too much and it&aposs interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life - Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control - You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety - You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem - You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors - if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don&apost seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It&aposs easier to treat if you get help early. The causes of anxiety disorders aren&apost fully understood. Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. Inherited traits also can be a factor. Medical causes For some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue. In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness. If your doctor suspects your anxiety may have a medical cause, he or she may order tests to look for signs of a problem. Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include: - Heart disease - Diabetes - Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism - Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma - Drug abuse or withdrawal - Withdrawal from alcohol, anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) or other medications - Chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome - Rare tumors that produce certain "fight-or-flight" hormones Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications. It&aposs possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if: - You don&apost have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder - You didn&apost have an anxiety disorder as a child - You don&apost avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety - You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn&apost have a previous history of anxiety These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder: - Trauma. Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders. - Stress due to an illness. Having a health condition or serious illness can cause significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future. - Stress buildup. A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety - for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances. - Personality. People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are. - Other mental health disorders. People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder. - Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can run in families. - Drugs or alcohol. Drug or alcohol use or abuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety. Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as: - Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders - Substance abuse - Trouble sleeping (insomnia) - Digestive or bowel problems - Headaches and chronic pain - Social isolation - Problems functioning at school or work - Poor quality of life - Suicide You may start by seeing your primary care doctor to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. Your doctor can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment. However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy). To help diagnose an anxiety disorder and rule out other conditions, your provider may: - Give you a psychological evaluation. This involves describing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems - such as depression or substance abuse - which can make diagnosis more challenging. - Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5. Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder. The two main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you&aposve avoided because of anxiety. CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms. Medications Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example: - Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders. - An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed. - In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a certain type of sedative called a benzodiazepine for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications. While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here&aposs what you can do: - Keep physically active. Develop a routine so that you&aposre physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances can cause or worsen anxiety. If you can&apost quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you. - Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking caffeinated beverages. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. - Use stress management and relaxation techniques. Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety. - Make sleep a priority. Do what you can to make sure you&aposre getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren&apost sleeping well, see your doctor. - Eat healthy. Healthy eating - such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish - may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed. Several herbal remedies have been studied as a treatment for anxiety, but more research is needed to understand the risks and benefits. Herbal and dietary supplements aren&apost monitored by the FDA the same way medications are. You can&apost always be certain of what you&aposre getting and whether it&aposs safe. Some of these supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions. Before taking herbal remedies or dietary supplements, talk to your doctor to make sure they&aposre safe for you and won&apost interact with any medications you take.

0.777777777778	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Uterine prolapse (Complications): Uterine prolapse is often associated with prolapse of other pelvic organs. You might experience: - Anterior prolapse (cystocele). Weakness of connective tissue separating the bladder and vagina may cause the bladder to bulge into the vagina. Anterior prolapse is also called prolapsed bladder. - Posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele). Weakness of connective tissue separating the rectum and vagina may cause the rectum to bulge into the vagina. You might have difficulty having bowel movements. Severe uterine prolapse can displace part of the vaginal lining, causing it to protrude outside the body. Vaginal tissue that rubs against clothing can lead to vaginal sores (ulcers.) Rarely, the sores can become infected.

-0.333333333333	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Anterior prolapse (cystocele) (Diagnosis): Diagnosis of anterior prolapse may involve: - A pelvic exam. You may be examined while lying down and while standing up. During the exam, your doctor looks for a tissue bulge into your vagina that indicates pelvic organ prolapse. You&aposll likely be asked to bear down as if during a bowel movement to see how much that affects the degree of prolapse. To check the strength of your pelvic floor muscles, you&aposll be asked to contract them, as if you&aposre trying to stop the stream of urine. - Filling out a questionnaire. You may fill out a form that helps your doctor assess the degree of your prolapse and how much it affects your quality of life. Information gathered also helps guide treatment decisions. - Bladder and urine tests. If you have significant prolapse, you might be tested to see how well and completely your bladder empties. Your doctor might also run a test on a urine sample to look for signs of a bladder infection, if it seems that you&aposre retaining more urine in your bladder than is normal after urinating.
-0.555555555556	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Uterine prolapse: Uterine prolapse occurs when pelvic floor muscles and ligaments stretch and weaken and no longer provide enough support for the uterus. As a result, the uterus slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina. Uterine prolapse can occur in women of any age. But it often affects postmenopausal women who&aposve had one or more vaginal deliveries. Mild uterine prolapse usually doesn&apost require treatment. But if uterine prolapse makes you uncomfortable or disrupts your normal life, you might benefit from treatment. Uterine prolapse care at Mayo Clinic Mild uterine prolapse generally doesn&apost cause signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms of moderate to severe uterine prolapse include: - Sensation of heaviness or pulling in your pelvis - Tissue protruding from your vagina - Urinary problems, such as urine leakage (incontinence) or urine retention - Trouble having a bowel movement - Feeling as if you&aposre sitting on a small ball or as if something is falling out of your vagina - Sexual concerns, such as a sensation of looseness in the tone of your vaginal tissue Often, symptoms are less bothersome in the morning and worsen as the day goes on. See your doctor to discuss your options if signs and symptoms of uterine prolapse become bothersome and disrupt your normal activities. Uterine prolapse results from the weakening of pelvic muscles and supportive tissues. Causes of weakened pelvic muscles and tissues include: - Pregnancy - Difficult labor and delivery or trauma during childbirth - Delivery of a large baby - Being overweight or obese - Lower estrogen level after menopause - Chronic constipation or straining with bowel movements - Chronic cough or bronchitis - Repeated heavy lifting Factors that can increase your risk of uterine prolapse include: - One or more pregnancies and vaginal births - Giving birth to a large baby - Increasing age - Obesity - Prior pelvic surgery - Chronic constipation or frequent straining during bowel movements - Family history of weakness in connective tissue - Being Hispanic or white Uterine prolapse is often associated with prolapse of other pelvic organs. You might experience: - Anterior prolapse (cystocele). Weakness of connective tissue separating the bladder and vagina may cause the bladder to bulge into the vagina. Anterior prolapse is also called prolapsed bladder. - Posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele). Weakness of connective tissue separating the rectum and vagina may cause the rectum to bulge into the vagina. You might have difficulty having bowel movements. Severe uterine prolapse can displace part of the vaginal lining, causing it to protrude outside the body. Vaginal tissue that rubs against clothing can lead to vaginal sores (ulcers.) Rarely, the sores can become infected. A diagnosis of uterine prolapse generally occurs during a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam your doctor is likely to ask you: - To bear down as if having a bowel movement. Bearing down can help your doctor assess how far the uterus has slipped into the vagina. - To tighten your pelvic muscles as if you&aposre stopping a stream of urine. This test checks the strength of your pelvic muscles. You might fill out a questionnaire that helps your doctor assess how uterine prolapse affects your quality of life. This information helps guide treatment decisions. If you have severe incontinence, your doctor might recommend tests to measure how well your bladder functions (urodynamic testing). Treatment depends on the severity of uterine prolapse. Your doctor might recommend: - Self-care measures. If your uterine prolapse causes few or no symptoms, simple self-care measures may provide relief or help prevent worsening prolapse. Self-care measures include performing Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles, losing weight and treating constipation. - Pessary. A vaginal pessary is a plastic or rubber ring inserted into your vagina to support the bulging tissues. A pessary must be removed regularly for cleaning. Surgery If uterine prolapse is severe, your doctor might recommend surgery. Minimally invasive (laparoscopic) or vaginal surgery might be an option. Surgery can involve: - Repair of weakened pelvic floor tissues. This surgery is generally approached through the vagina but sometimes through the abdomen. The surgeon might graft your own tissue, donor tissue or a synthetic material onto weakened pelvic floor structures to support your pelvic organs. - Removal of your uterus (hysterectomy). Hysterectomy might be recommended if uterine prolapse is severe. But hysterectomy is major surgery, and recent research suggests the surgery poses long-term health risks, including an increased risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) diseases and certain metabolic conditions. Talk with your doctor about all your treatment options to be sure you understand the risks and benefits of each so that you can choose what&aposs best for you. Depending on the severity of your uterine prolapse, self-care measures may provide relief. Try to: - Perform Kegel exercises to strengthen pelvic muscles and support the weakened fascia - Avoid constipation by eating high-fiber foods and drinking plenty of fluids - Avoid bearing down to move your bowels - Avoid heavy lifting - Control coughing - Lose weight if you&aposre overweight or obese Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. A strong pelvic floor provides better support for your pelvic organs, prevents prolapse from worsening and relieves symptoms associated with uterine prolapse. To perform Kegel exercises: - Tighten (contract) your pelvic floor muscles as though you were trying to prevent passing gas. - Hold the contraction for five seconds, and then relax for five seconds. If this is too difficult, start by holding for two seconds and relaxing for three seconds. - Work up to holding the contractions for 10 seconds at a time. - Aim for at least three sets of 10 repetitions each day. Kegel exercises may be most successful when they&aposre taught by a physical therapist and reinforced with biofeedback. Biofeedback involves using monitoring devices that help ensure you&aposre tightening the muscles properly for the best length of time. Once you&aposve learned the proper method, you can do Kegel exercises discreetly just about anytime, whether you&aposre sitting at your desk or relaxing on the couch.
1.88888888889	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Pelvic organ prolapse: Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and tissues supporting the pelvic organs (the uterus, bladder, or rectum) become weak or loose. This allows one or more of the pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina. Many women are embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms or think that their symptoms are normal. But pelvic organ prolapse is treatable. The pelvic muscles and tissues support the pelvic organs like a hammock. The pelvic organs include the bladder, uterus and cervix, vagina, and rectum, which is part of the bowel. A prolapse happens when the pelvis muscles and tissues can no longer support these organs because the muscles and tissues are weak or damaged. This causes one or more pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina. Pelvic organ prolapse is a type of pelvic floor disorder. The most common pelvic floor disorders are: The different types of pelvic organ prolapse depend on the pelvic organ affected. The most common types include: Although it is rare, pelvic organ prolapse can also happen after a hysterectomy. Any part of the vaginal wall may drop, causing a bulge into or out of the vagina. Pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse) affect one in five women in the United States.1 Pelvic organ prolapse is less common than urinary or fecal incontinence but affects almost 3% of U.S. women.1 Pelvic organ prolapse happens more often in older women and in white and Hispanic women than in younger women or women of other racial and ethnic groups.2,3 Some women develop more than one pelvic floor disorder, such as pelvic organ prolapse with urinary incontinence. The pressure from prolapse can cause a bulge in the vagina that can sometimes be felt or seen. Women with pelvic organ prolapse may feel uncomfortable pressure during physical activity or sex. Other symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse include: Some women say that their symptoms are worse at certain times of the day, during physical activity, or after standing for a long time. Talk to your doctor or nurse about your symptoms. Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles or connective tissues of the pelvis do not work as they should. The most common risk factors are: Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and do a pelvic exam. You may be asked to strain or cough during the exam so your doctor can see whether these actions cause prolapse or urine leakage. Your doctor may also do other tests to see whether you can completely empty your bladder when you go to the bathroom. Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse depends on the type of prolapse you have, your symptoms, your age, other health problems, and whether you are sexually active. Your treatment may include one or more of the following: Researchers are studying ways to prevent pelvic organ prolapse. The following steps may reduce your risk of getting a pelvic floor problem: For more information about pelvic organ prolapse, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:
-1.77777777778	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Rectal prolapse repair (Description): Rectal prolapse may be partial, involving only the inner lining of the bowel (mucosa). Or, it may be complete, involving the entire wall of the rectum. For most adults, surgery is used to repair the rectum because there is no other effective treatment. Children with rectal prolapse do not always need surgery, unless their prolapse does not improve over time. In infants, prolapse often disappears without treatment. Most surgical procedures for rectal prolapse are done under general anesthesia. For older or sicker people, epidural or spinal anesthesia may be used. There are 3 basic types of surgery to repair rectal prolapse. Your surgeon will decide which one is best for you. For healthy adults, an abdominal procedure has the best chance of success. While you are under general anesthesia, the doctor makes a surgical cut in the abdomen and removes a portion of the colon. The rectum may be attached (sutured) to the surrounding tissue so it will not slide and fall out through the anus. Sometimes, a soft piece of mesh is wrapped around the rectum to help it stay in place. These procedures can also be done with laparoscopic surgery (also known as keyhole or telescopic surgery). For older adults or those with other medical problems, an approach through the anus (perineal approach) might be less risky. It might also cause less pain and lead to a shorter recovery. But with this approach, the prolapse is more likely to come back (recur). One of the surgical repairs through the anus involves removing the prolapsed rectum and colon and then suturing the rectum to the surrounding tissues. This procedure can be done under general, epidural, or spinal anesthesia. Very frail or sick people may need a smaller procedure that reinforces the sphincter muscles. This technique encircles the muscles with a band of soft mesh or a silicone tube. This approach provides only short-term improvement and is rarely used.
-1.88888888889	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Uterine prolapse (Diagnosis): A diagnosis of uterine prolapse generally occurs during a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam your doctor is likely to ask you: - To bear down as if having a bowel movement. Bearing down can help your doctor assess how far the uterus has slipped into the vagina. - To tighten your pelvic muscles as if you&aposre stopping a stream of urine. This test checks the strength of your pelvic muscles. You might fill out a questionnaire that helps your doctor assess how uterine prolapse affects your quality of life. This information helps guide treatment decisions. If you have severe incontinence, your doctor might recommend tests to measure how well your bladder functions (urodynamic testing).
2.0	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Anterior prolapse (cystocele) (Causes): Your pelvic floor consists of muscles, ligaments and connective tissues that support your bladder and other pelvic organs. The connections between your pelvic floor muscles and ligaments can weaken over time, as a result of trauma from childbirth or chronic straining of pelvic floor muscles. When this happens, your bladder can slip down lower than normal and bulge into your vagina (anterior prolapse). Possible causes of anterior prolapse include: - Pregnancy and vaginal childbirth - Being overweight or obese - Repeated heavy lifting - Straining with bowel movements - A chronic cough or bronchitis
-0.444444444444	how do you get a prolapse bladder	Anterior prolapse (cystocele) (Symptoms): In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: - A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina - Increased discomfort when you strain, cough, bear down or lift - A feeling that you haven&apost completely emptied your bladder after urinating - Repeated bladder infections - Pain or urinary leakage during sexual intercourse - In severe cases, a bulge of tissue that protrudes through your vaginal opening and may feel like sitting on an egg Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down. When to see a doctor A severely prolapsed bladder can be uncomfortable. It can make emptying your bladder difficult and may lead to bladder infections. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that bother you.
1.0	how do you get neuromuscular disorders	Neuromuscular Disorders (Summary): Summary Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells, also called neurons, send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching, cramps, aches and pains, and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe. Examples of neuromuscular disorders include - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Spinal muscular atrophy Many neuromuscular diseases are genetic, which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life.
-0.333333333333	how do you get neuromuscular disorders	Myasthenia gravis (Summary): Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders involve the muscles and the nerves that control them.
0.777777777778	how do you get neuromuscular disorders	Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders involve the muscles and the nerves that control them. Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Antibodies are proteins made by the body&aposs immune system when it detects harmful substances. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue a harmful substance, such as in the case of myasthenia gravis. In people with myasthenia gravis, the body produces antibodies that block the muscle cells from receiving messages (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. The exact cause of myasthenia gravis is unknown. In some cases, it is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system). Myasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men. Myasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles -- muscles that are under your control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest. This muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including: - Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles - Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling - Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position - Difficulty talking - Drooping head and eyelids - Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles - Fatigue - Hoarseness or changing voice - Double vision - Difficulty maintaining steady gaze The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This includes a detailed nervous system (neurological) examination. This may show: - Muscle weakness, with eye muscles usually affected first - Normal reflexes and feeling (sensation) Tests that may be done include: - Acetylcholine receptor antibodies associated with this disease - CT or MRI scan of the chest to look for a tumor - Nerve conduction studies - EMG - Pulmonary function tests - Edrophonium test to see if this medicine reverses the symptoms for a short time There is no known cure for myasthenia gravis. Treatment may allow you to have periods without any symptoms (remission). Lifestyle changes can often help you continue your daily activities. The following may be recommended: - Resting throughout the day - Using an eye patch if double vision is bothersome - Avoiding stress and heat exposure, which can make symptoms worse Medicines that may be prescribed include: - Neostigmine or pyridostigmine to improve communication between the nerves and muscles - Prednisone and other drugs (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil) to suppress the immune system response if you have severe symptoms and other medicines have not worked well. Crisis situations are attacks of weakness of the breathing muscles. These attacks can occur without warning when either too much or too little medicine is taken. These attacks usually last no longer than a few weeks. You may need to be admitted to the hospital, where you may need breathing assistance with a ventilator. A procedure called plasmapheresis may also be used to help end the crisis. This procedure involves removing the clear part of the blood (plasma), which contains the antibodies. This is replaced with donated plasma that is free of antibodies, or with other fluids. Plasmapheresis may also help reduce symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks and is often used before surgery. Another procedure, called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), may also be done. With this procedure, a large amount of helpful antibodies are given directly into the bloodstream. Surgery to remove the thymus (thymectomy) may result in permanent remission or less need for medicines, especially when there is a tumor present. If you have eye problems, your doctor may suggest lens prisms to improve vision. Surgery may also be recommended to treat your eye muscles. Physical therapy can help maintain your muscle strength. This is especially important for the muscles that support breathing. Some medicines can worsen symptoms and should be avoided. Before taking any medicine, ask your doctor whether it is OK for you to take it. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a myasthenia gravis support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. There is no cure, but long-term remission is possible. You may have to restrict some daily activities. People who have only eye symptoms (ocular myasthenia gravis), may develop generalized myasthenia over time. A woman with myasthenia gravis can get pregnant, but careful prenatal care is important. The baby may be weak and require medications for a few weeks after birth, but usually will not develop the disorder. The condition may cause life-threatening breathing problems. This is called a myasthenic crisis. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at higher risk for other autoimmune disorders, such as thyrotoxicosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have breathing difficulty or swallowing problems.

-1.88888888889	how do you get neuromuscular disorders	TMJ disorders (Causes): There are 2 matching temporomandibular joints on each side of your head. They are located just in front of your ears. The abbreviation "TMJ" refers to the name of the joint, but it is often used to mean any disorders or symptoms of this region. Many TMJ-related symptoms are caused by the effects of physical stress on the structures around the joint. These structures include: - Cartilage disk at the joint - Muscles of the jaw, face, and neck - Nearby ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves - Teeth For many people with temporomandibular joint disorders, the cause is unknown. Some causes given for this condition are not well-proven. They include: - A bad bite or orthodontic braces. - Stress and tooth grinding. Many people with TMJ problems do not grind their teeth, and many who have been grinding their teeth for a long time do not have problems with their temporomandibular joint. For some people, the stress associated with this disorder may be caused by the pain, as opposed to being the cause of the problem. Poor posture can also be an important factor in TMJ symptoms. For example, holding your head forward while looking at a computer all day strains the muscles of your face and neck. Other factors that may make TMJ symptoms worse include stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep. Many people end up having "trigger points." These are contracted muscles in your jaw, head, and neck. Trigger points can refer pain to other areas, causing a headache, earache, or toothache. Other possible causes of TMJ-related symptoms include arthritis, fractures, dislocations, and structural problems present since birth.

1.875	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis - Birth defects of the heart - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) - Heart failure - Heart valve disease - HIV infection - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) - Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension.
0.625	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	How to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension?: Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they&aposre often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it&aposs working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that&aposs causing or contributing to PH. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart&aposs electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart&aposs rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung&aposs blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don&apost cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You&aposre comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You&aposre comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You&aposre not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one.
-1.875	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	Portal hypertension (Summary): Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in branches of the portal vein, the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver. Portal hypertension itself does not cause symptoms, but complications from the condition can lead to an enlarged abdomen, abdominal discomfort, confusion, drowsiness and internal bleeding. It may be caused by a variety of conditions, but cirrhosis is the most common cause in Western countries. [1] [2] Treatment is generally directed toward the cause of the condition, although emergency treatment is sometimes needed for serious complications. [2]
-0.75	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Treatment): There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: - Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH - Oxygen therapy at home - Heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: - Avoid pregnancy - Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting - Avoid traveling to high altitudes - Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine - Stop smoking
-0.625	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Summary): Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal.
1.75	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease) - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs&apos air sacs (interstitium) - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It&aposs most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.
0.5	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	pulmonary arterial hypertension (Inheritance Pattern): Pulmonary arterial hypertension is usually sporadic, which means it occurs in individuals with no known family history of the disorder. These non-familial cases are described as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. About 20 percent of these cases are caused by mutations in one of the genes known to be associated with the disease, but most of the time a causative gene mutation has not been identified. Inherited cases of this disorder are known as familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. When the condition is inherited, it most often has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, many people with an altered gene never develop pulmonary arterial hypertension; this phenomenon is called reduced penetrance.
2.0	how do you get pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. ("Inherited" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to "Types of Pulmonary Hypertension."
2.0	how do you test for cholesterol level in your body	High cholesterol (Diagnosis): A blood test to check cholesterol levels - called a lipid panel or lipid profile - typically reports: - Total cholesterol - LDL cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - Triglycerides - a type of fat in the blood For the most accurate measurements, don&apost eat or drink anything (other than water) for nine to 12 hours before the blood sample is taken. Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group. If your child has a family history of early-onset heart disease or a personal history of obesity or diabetes, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent cholesterol testing.
1.83333333333	how do you test for cholesterol level in your body	How to diagnose High blood cholesterol levels?: A cholesterol test is done to diagnose a lipid disorder. Some guidelines recommend having your first screening cholesterol test at age 20. Everyone should have their first screening test by age 35 in men, and age 45 in women. (Note: Different experts recommend different starting ages.) It is important to work with your health care provider to set your cholesterol goals. Newer guidelines steer doctors away from targeting specific levels of cholesterol. Instead, it recommends different medicines and doses depending on a person&aposs history and risk factor profile. General targets are: - LDL: 70 to 130 mg/dL (lower numbers are better) - HDL: more than 50 mg/dL (high numbers are better) - Total cholesterol: less than 200 mg/dL (lower numbers are better) - Triglycerides: 10 to 150 mg/dL (lower numbers are better) If your cholesterol results are abnormal, you may also have other tests such as: - Blood sugar (glucose) test to look for diabetes - Kidney function tests - Thyroid function tests to look for an underactive thyroid gland
-0.333333333333	how do you test for cholesterol level in your body	Cholesterol testing and results (When Should You Be Tested?): Everyone should have their first screening test by age 35 for men, and age 45 for women. Some guidelines recommend starting at age 20. You should have a cholesterol test done at an earlier age if you have: - Diabetes - Heart disease - Stroke - High blood pressure - A strong family history of heart disease Follow-up testing should be done: - Every 5 years if your results were normal - More often for people with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or blood flow problems to the legs or feet - Every year or so if you are taking medicines to control high cholesterol
-1.66666666667	how do you test for cholesterol level in your body	Sitosterolemia (Diagnosis): Sitosterolemia is diagnosed by measuring the levels of plant sterols in the blood, including sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol. Normal cholesterol studies will not diagnosed sitosterolemia because they cannot distinguish among the different sterols. DNA analysis of the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes can be helpful in detecting mutations and confirming the diagnosis. [2] [3] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.
-1.83333333333	how do you test for cholesterol level in your body	Hypercalcemia (Exams and Tests): An accurate diagnosis is needed in hypercalcemia. Patients with kidney stones should have tests to evaluate for hypercalcemia. - Serum calcium - Serum PTH - Serum PTHrP (PTH-related protein) - Serum vitamin D level - Urine calcium
-0.5	how do you test for cholesterol level in your body	Triglyceride level: The triglyceride level is a blood test to measure the amount of triglycerides in your blood. Triglycerides are a type of fat. Your body makes some triglycerides. Triglycerides also come from the food you eat. Extra calories are turned into triglycerides and stored in fat cells for later use. If you eat more calories than your body needs, your triglyceride level may be high. A test for high blood cholesterol levels is a related measurement. A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. You should not eat for 8 to 12 hours before the test. Alcohol and some medicines can interfere with blood test results. - Make sure your health care provider knows what medicines you take, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. - Your provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. - DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Triglycerides are usually measured together with other blood fats. Often it is done to help determine your risk of developing heart disease. A high triglyceride level may lead to atherosclerosis, which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. A high triglyceride level may also cause swelling of your pancreas (called pancreatitis). Results may indicate: - Normal: Less than 150 mg/dL - Borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dL - High: 200 to 499 mg/dL - Very high: 500 mg/dL or above Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. High triglyceride levels may be due to: - Cirrhosis or liver damage - Diet low in protein and high in carbohydrates - Underactive thyroid - Nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder) - Other medicines such as female hormones - Poorly controlled diabetes - Disorder passed down through families in which there are high amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Overall, the treatment of elevated triglyceride levels focuses on increased exercise and changes in the diet. Drugs to lower triglyceride levels may be used to prevent pancreatitis for levels above 500 mg/dL. Low triglyceride levels may be due to: - Low fat diet - Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) - Malabsorption syndrome (conditions in which the small intestine does not absorb fats well) - Malnutrition Pregnancy can affect test results.

1.85714285714	how is a heart attack treated	Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&aposs blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&aposll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&aposll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less "sticky" and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&aposs job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&aposs passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&aposve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&aposre likely to remain in the hospital for several days.
2.0	how is a heart attack treated	Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn&apost have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
-0.571428571429	how is a heart attack treated	What is Heart Attack?: A heart attack occurs when the supply of blood and oxygen to an area of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery. If the blockage is not treated within a few hours, the heart muscle will be permanently damaged and replaced by scar tissue.
-0.428571428571	how is a heart attack treated	What is Heart Attack?: Angina is a recurring pain or discomfort in the chest that happens when some part of the heart does not receive enough blood. An episode of angina is not a heart attack. However, people with angina may have a hard time telling the difference between angina and heart attack symptoms. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle does not get enough blood. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It may also feel like indigestion. It is usually relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medicine.
-0.714285714286	how is a heart attack treated	What is Heart Attack?: Having a heart attack increases your chances of having another one. Therefore, it is very important that you and your family know how and when to seek medical attention. Talk to your doctor about making an emergency action plan, and discuss it with your family. The emergency action plan should include - warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack - instructions for accessing emergency medical services in your community, including calling 9-1-1 - steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive, such as taking aspirin and nitroglycerin - important information to take along with you to the hospital, such as a list of medications that you take or that you are allergic to, and name and number of whom you should contact if you go to the hospital. warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack instructions for accessing emergency medical services in your community, including calling 9-1-1 steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive, such as taking aspirin and nitroglycerin important information to take along with you to the hospital, such as a list of medications that you take or that you are allergic to, and name and number of whom you should contact if you go to the hospital.
0.714285714286	how is a heart attack treated	Heart attack (Lifestyle and home remedies): Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart&aposs health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn&apost be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.

2.0	how is asthma diagnosed	Asthma (Diagnosis): Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma—that is, whether it&aposs intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you&aposll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You&aposve had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You&aposre thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to "What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don&apost have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it&aposs hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don&apost go on to have asthma after they&aposre 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn&apost have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it&aposs hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children&aposs medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds.
-0.777777777778	how is asthma diagnosed	What is Asthma?: Espaol Asthma (AZ-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7million of these people are children. Overview To understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. This chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed. Asthma Sometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse. When symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you&aposre having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns). Treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. Outlook Asthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. However, with today&aposs knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma. If you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers.
-0.888888888889	how is asthma diagnosed	What is Asthma?: Asthma is a disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.
-0.666666666667	how is asthma diagnosed	What is Asthma?: Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air. Symptoms of asthma include - Wheezing - Coughing, especially early in the morning or at night - Chest tightness - Shortness of breath Not all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms doesn&apost always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. You may also have allergy tests. When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it&aposs called an asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
1.88888888889	how is asthma diagnosed	Asthma (Diagnosis): Physical exam To rule out other possible conditions - such as a respiratory infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems. Tests to measure lung function You may also be given lung (pulmonary) function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include: - Spirometry. This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out. - Peak flow. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings. Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol, to open your airways. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it&aposs likely you have asthma. Additional tests Other tests to diagnose asthma include: - Methacholine challenge. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger that, when inhaled, will cause mild constriction of your airways. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal. - Nitric oxide test. This test, though not widely available, measures the amount of the gas, nitric oxide, that you have in your breath. When your airways are inflamed - a sign of asthma - you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. - Imaging tests. A chest X-ray and high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scan of your lungs and nose cavities (sinuses) can identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems. - Allergy testing. This can be performed by a skin test or blood test. Allergy tests can identify allergy to pets, dust, mold and pollen. If important allergy triggers are identified, this can lead to a recommendation for allergen immunotherapy. - Sputum eosinophils. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye (eosin). - Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air. How asthma is classified To classify your asthma severity, your doctor considers your answers to questions about symptoms (such as how often you have asthma attacks and how bad they are), along with the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests. Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments. Asthma is classified into four general categories:
1.77777777778	how is asthma diagnosed	Asthma (Exams and Tests): The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard. Tests that may be ordered include: - Allergy testing -- skin or a blood test to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances - Arterial blood gas (usually only done with people who are having a severe asthma attack) - Chest x-ray - Lung function tests, including peak flow measurements
0.666666666667	how is asthma diagnosed	Asthma - children (Exams and Tests): The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to the child&aposs lungs. The provider may be able to hear asthma sounds. However, lung sounds are often normal when the child is not having an asthma episode. The provider will have the child breathe into a device called a peak flow meter. Peak flow meters can tell how well the child can blow air out of the lungs. If the airways are narrow due to asthma, peak flow values drop. You and your child will learn to measure peak flow at home. Tests may include: - Allergy testing on the skin, or a blood test to see if your child is allergic to certain substances - Chest x-ray - Lung function tests
0.555555555556	how is asthma diagnosed	Asthma attack (Diagnosis): For adults and children over 5 years old, lung (pulmonary) function tests are used to check how well the lungs are working. Poor lung function is a sign that your asthma isn&apost well-controlled. In some cases, lung function tests are also used in asthma emergencies to help check the severity of an asthma attack or how well treatment is working. Lung function tests include: - Peak flow. Your doctor may take a peak flow reading when you come in for a scheduled visit or for emergency treatment during an asthma attack. This test measures how quickly you can breathe out. You also may use a peak flow meter at home to monitor your lung function. The results of this test are known as peak expiratory flow (PEF). A peak flow test is done by blowing into a mouthpiece as hard and as fast as you can with a single breath (expiration). - Spirometry. During spirometry, you take deep breaths and forcefully exhale into a hose connected to a machine called a spirometer. A common spirometry measurement is forced expiratory volume, which measures how much air you can breathe out in one second. The results of this test are known as forced expiratory volume (FEV). Spirometry can also measure how much air your lungs can hold and the rate at which you can inhale and exhale. - Nitric oxide measurement. A newer diagnostic test, this exam measures the amount of nitric oxide gas you have in your breath when you exhale. High nitric oxide readings indicate inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Exhaled nitric oxide can be measured by having a patient exhale directly into an analyzer. Exhaled air may be captured in a nitric-oxide-impervious container for measurement later. - Pulse oximetry. This test is used during a severe asthma attack. It measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. It&aposs measured through your fingernail and only takes seconds.
-0.555555555556	how is asthma diagnosed	Asthma - children (When to Contact a Medical Professional): Call your child&aposs provider if you think your child has new symptoms of asthma. If your child has been diagnosed with asthma, call the provider: - After an emergency room visit - When peak flow numbers have been getting lower - When symptoms get more frequent and more severe, even though your child is following the asthma action plan If your child is having trouble breathing or having an asthma attack, get medical help right away. Emergency symptoms include: - Difficulty breathing - Bluish color to the lips and face - Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath - Rapid pulse - Sweating - Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion A child who is having a severe asthma attack may need to stay in the hospital and get oxygen and medicines through a vein (intravenous line or IV).
2.0	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	Trisomy 18 (Exams and Tests): An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone. Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation. Other signs include: - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma) - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti) - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as: - Atrial septal defect (ASD) - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tests may also show kidney problems, including: - Horseshoe kidney - Hydronephrosis - Polycystic kidney
-1.7	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	What is Down syndrome?: Down syndrome is a chromosome disorder associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and low muscle tone in infancy. The degree of intellectual disability varies from mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may also be born with various health concerns such as heart defects or digestive abnormalities. They also have an increased risk to develop gastroesophageal reflux, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hearing and vision problems, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21) instead of the usual two copies and is typically not inherited. Treatment focuses on the specific symptoms in each person.
0.8	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	Trisomy 18 (Prevention): Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome. Genetic testing is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.
-1.8	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	What is Down syndrome?: Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition that is associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy. All affected individuals experience cognitive delays, but the intellectual disability is usually mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may have a variety of birth defects. About half of all affected children are born with a heart defect. Digestive abnormalities, such as a blockage of the intestine, are less common. Individuals with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing several medical conditions. These include gastroesophageal reflux, which is a backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus, and celiac disease, which is an intolerance of a wheat protein called gluten. About 15 percent of people with Down syndrome have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ in the lower neck that produces hormones. Individuals with Down syndrome also have an increased risk of hearing and vision problems. Additionally, a small percentage of children with Down syndrome develop cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia). Delayed development and behavioral problems are often reported in children with Down syndrome. Affected individuals&apos speech and language develop later and more slowly than in children without Down syndrome, and affected individuals&apos speech may be more difficult to understand. Behavioral issues can include attention problems, obsessive/compulsive behavior, and stubbornness or tantrums. A small percentage of people with Down syndrome are also diagnosed with developmental conditions called autism spectrum disorders, which affect communication and social interaction. People with Down syndrome often experience a gradual decline in thinking ability (cognition) as they age, usually starting around age 50. Down syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Approximately half of adults with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer disease. Although Alzheimer disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, people with Down syndrome usually develop this condition in their fifties or sixties.
1.9	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	Trisomy 18: Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from chromosome 18, instead of the usual 2 copies. Trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6,000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys. The syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development. Symptoms may include: - Clenched hands - Crossed legs - Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet) - Low birth weight - Low-set ears - Mental delay - Poorly developed fingernails - Small head (microcephaly) - Small jaw (micrognathia) - Undescended testicle - Unusual shaped chest (pectus carinatum) An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone. Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism).

Which treatments are used depend on the person&aposs individual condition. Support groups include: - Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders (SOFT): trisomy.org - Trisomy 18 Foundation: www.trisomy18.org - Hope for Trisomy 13 and 18: www.hopefortrisomy13and18.org Half of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. Nine out of 10 children will die by 1 year of age. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems. Complications depend on the specific defects and symptoms. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the person. Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome. Genetic testing is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.

2.0	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	Generalized anxiety disorder (Diagnosis): To help diagnose generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor or mental health professional may: - Do a physical exam to look for signs that your anxiety might be linked to medications or an underlying medical condition - Order blood or urine tests or other tests, if a medical condition is suspected - Ask detailed questions about your symptoms and medical history - Use psychological questionnaires to help determine a diagnosis - Use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association
-0.428571428571	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	What is Generalized anxiety disorder?: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition in which a person is often worried or anxious about many things and finds it hard to control this anxiety.
-0.285714285714	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	Generalized anxiety disorder (Risk factors): Women are diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder somewhat more often than men are. The following factors may increase the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder: - Personality. A person whose temperament is timid or negative or who avoids anything dangerous may be more prone to generalized anxiety disorder than others are. - Genetics. Generalized anxiety disorder may run in families. - Experiences. People with generalized anxiety disorder may have a history of significant life changes, traumatic or negative experiences during childhood, or a recent traumatic or negative event. Chronic medical illnesses or other mental health disorders may increase risk.
-0.857142857143	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	Generalized anxiety disorder (Treatment): Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you&aposve avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren&apost a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.
-0.714285714286	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	Generalized anxiety disorder (Causes): As with many mental health conditions, the cause of generalized anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors, which may include: - Differences in brain chemistry and function - Genetics - Differences in the way threats are perceived - Development and personality
-0.571428571429	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	Generalized anxiety disorder (Symptoms): Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include: - Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events - Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes - Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren&apost - Difficulty handling uncertainty - Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision - Inability to set aside or let go of a worry - Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge - Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind "goes blank" Physical signs and symptoms may include: - Fatigue - Trouble sleeping - Muscle tension or muscle aches - Trembling, feeling twitchy - Nervousness or being easily startled - Sweating - Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome - Irritability There may be times when your worries don&apost completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there&aposs no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen. Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life. Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age. Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults, but also may have excessive worries about: - Performance at school or sporting events - Family members&apos safety - Being on time (punctuality) - Earthquakes, nuclear war or other catastrophic events A child or teen with excessive worry may: - Feel overly anxious to fit in - Be a perfectionist - Redo tasks because they aren&apost perfect the first time - Spend excessive time doing homework - Lack confidence - Strive for approval - Require a lot of reassurance about performance - Have frequent stomachaches or other physical complaints - Avoid going to school or avoid social situations Some anxiety is normal, but see your doctor if: - You feel like you&aposre worrying too much, and it&aposs interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life - You feel depressed or irritable, have trouble with drinking or drugs, or you have other mental health concerns along with anxiety - You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors - seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries are unlikely to simply go away on their own, and they may actually get worse over time. Try to seek professional help before your anxiety becomes severe - it may be easier to treat early on.
1.85714285714	how is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed	Generalized anxiety disorder (Exams and Tests): There is no test that can make a diagnosis of GAD. The diagnosis is based on your answers to questions about the symptoms of GAD. Your health care provider will ask about these symptoms. You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health. A physical exam or lab tests may be done to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms.
0.555555555556	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	Gonorrhea (Do I need to get tested for gonorrhea?): You also need to get tested if you have any symptoms of gonorrhea. Testing is very important, because women with untreated gonorrhea can develop serious health problems. If you are tested for gonorrhea, you also need to get tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV.
-0.555555555556	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	What is Gonorrhea?: Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI).
-0.666666666667	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	What is Gonorrhea?: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth. Gonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. In men, gonorrhea can cause pain when urinating and discharge from the penis. If untreated, it can cause problems with the prostate and testicles. In women, the early symptoms of gonorrhea often are mild. Later, it can cause bleeding between periods, pain when urinating, and increased discharge from the vagina. If untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which causes problems with pregnancy and infertility. Your health care provider will diagnose gonorrhea with lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Treating gonorrhea is becoming more difficult because drug-resistant strains are increasing. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
1.88888888889	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	Gonorrhea (Diagnosis): To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well.
2.0	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	Gonorrhea (Exams and Tests): Gonorrhea can be quickly detected by looking at a sample of discharge or tissue under the microscope. This is called a gram stain. This method is fast, but it is not the most certain. Gonorrhea is most accurately detected with DNA tests. DNA tests are useful for screening. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) test is one of the tests. DNA tests are quicker than cultures. These tests can be performed on urine samples, which are easier to collect than samples from the genital area. Prior to DNA tests, cultures (cells that grow in a lab dish) were used to provide proof of gonorrhea, but are less commonly used now. Samples for a culture are most often taken from the cervix, vagina, urethra, anus, or throat. - Rarely they are taken from joint fluid or blood - Cultures can often provide an early diagnosis within 24 hours. A confirmed diagnosis is available within 72 hours. If you have gonorrhea, you should ask to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV herpes and hepatitis.
0.666666666667	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is usually spread by having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Antibiotics can treat gonorrhea. If left untreated, it can cause serious health problems, including problems getting pregnant. Gonorrhea is an STI that is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is an especially serious problem for women because it can damage the female reproductive organs. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Gonorrhea most often affects women ages 15 to 24. But, gonorrhea is becoming more common in older women too.1 Gonorrhea is spread through: Most women with gonorrhea do not have any signs or symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Signs or symptoms of gonorrhea depend on where you are first infected by the gonorrhea bacteria. Signs and symptoms in the genital area can include: Signs and symptoms in other parts of the body include: Gonorrhea can cause serious health problems, even if you do not have any signs or symptoms. You also need to get tested if you have any symptoms of gonorrhea. Testing is very important, because women with untreated gonorrhea can develop serious health problems. If you are tested for gonorrhea, you also need to get tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. There are two ways that a doctor or nurse tests for gonorrhea: A Pap test is not used to detect gonorrhea. Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat gonorrhea. The antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow. Although antibiotics can cure gonorrhea, they cannot fix any permanent damage done to your body. For this reason, it is important to get tested and to take the antibiotics as soon as possible. For the antibiotics to work, you must finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor gives you, even if the symptoms go away. Do not share your antibiotics for gonorrhea with anyone. If symptoms do not go away after treatment, see your doctor or nurse. It is possible to get gonorrhea again if you have sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Gonorrhea that is not treated can cause serious health problems in women:3 Gonorrhea is easy to treat. But you need to get tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have gonorrhea: For pregnant women, untreated gonorrhea raises the risk of: Babies born to infected mothers are at risk for: Treatment of gonorrhea as soon as it is found in pregnant women will lower the risk of these problems for both mother and baby. Your baby will get antibiotics if you have gonorrhea or if your baby has a gonorrheal eye infection. The best way to prevent gonorrhea or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps: The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI. Yes. It is possible to get gonorrhea, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women. Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of gonorrhea.

1.77777777778	how is gonorrhea diagnosed	Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you&aposre infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, gonorrhea infection can affect multiple sites in your body, but it commonly appears in the genital tract. Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: - Painful urination - Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis - Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: - Increased vaginal discharge - Painful urination - Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse - Painful intercourse - Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea at other sites in the body Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: - Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements. - Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes may cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes. - Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection may include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. - Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints may be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially when you move an affected joint. When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum. Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Factors that may increase your risk of gonorrhea infection include: - Younger age - A new sex partner - A sex partner who has concurrent partners - Multiple sex partners - Previous gonorrhea diagnosis - Having other sexually transmitted infections Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as: - Infertility in women. Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment. - Infertility in men. Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility. - Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results. - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners. - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing.

Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally. Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you&aposve been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn&apost treated. Gonorrhea treatment for babies Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea receive a medication in their eyes soon after birth to prevent infection. If an eye infection develops, babies can be treated with antibiotics.

1.6	how is hemophilia treated	Hemophilia A (Treatment): People with inherited hemophilia A require life-long care, preferably through a specialized hemophilia treatment center. Although there is no cure for hemophilia A, current treatments usually work well. Treatment primarily consists of replacing the missing clotting factor VIII ( replacement therapy) and preventing complications that are associated with the disorder. The type and frequency of treatment often depends on the severity of the disorder in each person. People with mild or moderate hemophilia A may be treated with replacement therapy as needed (for example, when a specific bleeding episode occurs). This is called episodic therapy. Some people with mild hemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Desmopressin raises the levels of factor VIII in the blood and may be taken intravenously or through a nasal spray. Drugs known as antifibrinolytics, which slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood, can also be used to treat those with a mild form of the disorder. Some people with severe hemophilia A may receive periodic factor VIII infusions to prevent bleeding episodes and associated complications such as joint damage. This is referred to as prophylactic therapy. People can be trained to give infusions at home. This is especially important for people with severe disease because the infusion works the best within one hour of a bleeding episode. In general, rapid treatment is important because it reduces pain and damage to the joints, muscles or other affected tissues or organs .

-0.8	how is hemophilia treated	What are hemophilia?: Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases of hemophilia, continuous bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. Milder forms of hemophilia do not necessarily involve spontaneous bleeding, and the condition may not become apparent until abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury. The major types of this condition are hemophilia A (also known as classic hemophilia or factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (also known as Christmas disease or factor IX deficiency). Although the two types have very similar signs and symptoms, they are caused by mutations in different genes. People with an unusual form of hemophilia B, known as hemophilia B Leyden, experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty.
1.8	how is hemophilia treated	Hemophilia A (Treatment): Treatment includes replacing the missing clotting factor. You will receive factor VIII concentrates. How much you get depends on: - Severity of bleeding - Site of bleeding - Your weight and height Mild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). This medicine helps the body release factor VIII that is stored within the lining of blood vessels. To prevent a bleeding crisis, people with hemophilia and their families can be taught to give factor VIII concentrates at home at the first signs of bleeding. People with severe forms of the disease may need regular preventive treatment. DDAVP or factor VIII concentrate may also be needed before having dental extractions or surgery. You should get the hepatitis B vaccine. People with hemophilia are more likely to get hepatitis B because they may receive blood products. Some people with hemophilia A develop antibodies to factor VIII. These antibodies are called inhibitors. The inhibitors attack factor VIII so that it no longer works. In such cases, a man-made clotting factor called VIIa can be given.
0.4	how is hemophilia treated	Hemophilia (Treatment): The most common treatment is to replace the missing clotting factor in the blood through a vein (intravenous infusions). Special care during surgery needs to be taken if you have this bleeding disorder. So, be sure to tell your surgeon that you have this disorder. It is also very important to share information about your disorder with blood relatives as they may also be affected.
2.0	how is hemophilia treated	Hemophilia: Español Hemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn&apost clot normally. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. "Inherited” means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow—a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you&aposre missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you&aposre missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. "Acquired” means you aren&apost born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don&apost have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than  1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a "hemophilia carrier” and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren&apost carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia—Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia—Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body&aposs surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn&apost treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they&aposre adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have "preimplantation diagnosis" to have children who don&apost have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that&aposs missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren&apost made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home—it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there&aposs a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20–30 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2–5 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as:   Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint&aposs function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child&aposs doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in "Living With Hemophilia”). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn&apost used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it&aposs used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They&aposre usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn&apost yet developed to the point that it&aposs an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the "Clinical Trials" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you&aposll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you&aposll be having. Mild hemophilia—Replacement therapy usually isn&apost needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body&aposs level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia—You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia—You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They&aposre also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers&apos emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&aposs Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child&aposs needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers—such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist—that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you&aposll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can&apost be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can&apost be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It&aposs a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn&apost their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you&aposll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child&aposs babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9–1–1 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor&aposs office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you&aposre treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9–1–1. When you&aposre traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It&aposs a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It&aposs important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it&aposs important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job.

Families have many things in common, including their genes, environment, and lifestyle. Together, these things may offer clues to diseases, like late- and early-onset Alzheimer&aposs, that can run in a family. Share this infographic and help spread the word about Alzheimer&aposs genetics. There is no test yet to predict if someone will get late-onset Alzheimer&aposs, in which symptoms become apparent in a person&aposs mid-60s. If someone is worried about changes in his or her memory or other problems with thinking, he or she should talk with a doctor.A doctor may ask the patient to make a family health history. A family health history can help a person know if Alzheimer&aposs disease runs in the family. It lists health facts about a person and close relatives. It is a written record of:- A family&aposs health conditions - Lifestyle habits like smoking and exercise - Where and how family members grew upA family health history can show patterns of disease and risk factors. Try to include health facts about three generations-grandparents, parents, and children.People can&apost change the genes they inherit from their parents, but they can change things like diet, physical activity, and medical care to prevent diseases that may run in the family.Steps to Maintain Cognitive Health A doctor may suggest steps to stay healthy and watch for changes in memory and thinking. Steps include: - Exercise regularly. - Eat a healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. - Spend time with family and friends. - Keep one&aposs mind active. - Control type 2 diabetes. - Keep blood pressure and cholesterol at healthy levels. - Maintain a healthy body weight. - Stop smoking. - Get help for depression. - Avoid drinking a lot of alcohol. - Get plenty of sleep. There is a test to learn if a person has the gene changes that cause familial Alzheimer&aposs disease, or FAD, which occurs between a person&aposs 30s and mid-60s.If someone has a family history of FAD, he or she should talk with a doctor about getting tested.A doctor may suggest meeting first with a genetic counselor. This type of counselor helps people learn the risk of getting genetic conditions. They also help people make decisions about testing and what comes next. Scientists believe that many factors influence when Alzheimer&aposs disease begins and how it progresses.Increasing age is the most important known risk factor for Alzheimer&aposs. The number of people with the disease doubles every 5 years beyond age 65. About one-third of all people age 85 and older may have Alzheimer&aposs disease.The causes of late-onset Alzheimer&aposs, the most common form of the disease, probably include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of development Alzheimer&aposs may differ from person to person.Scientists are learning how age-related changes in the brain may harm nerve cells and contribute to Alzheimer&aposs damage. These age-related changes include atrophy (shrinking) of certain parts of the brain, inflammation, production of unstable molecules called free radicals, and breakdown of energy production within cells.As scientists learn more about this devastating disease, they realize that genes also play an important role.

Each human cell contains the instructions a cell needs to do its job. These instructions are made up of DNA, which is packed tightly into structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome has thousands of segments called genes.Genes are passed down from a person&aposs birth parents. They carry information that defines traits such as eye color and height. Genes also play a role in keeping the body&aposs cells healthy. Problems with genes-even small changes to a gene-can cause diseases like Alzheimer&aposs disease. Some diseases are caused by a genetic mutation, or permanent change in one or more specific genes. If a person inherits from a parent a genetic mutation that causes a certain disease, then he or she will usually get the disease. Sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset familial Alzheimer&aposs disease are examples of inherited genetic disorders.In other diseases, a genetic variant may occur. A single gene can have many variants. Sometimes, this difference in a gene can cause a disease directly. More often, a variant plays a role in increasing or decreasing a person&aposs risk of developing a disease or condition. When a genetic variant increases disease risk but does not directly cause a disease, it is called a genetic risk factor. There are two types of Alzheimer&aposs-early-onset and late-onset. Both types have a genetic component.Some Differences Between Late-Onset and Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Disease Late-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Signs first appear in a person&aposs mid-60s Signs first appear between a person&aposs 30s and mid-60s Most common type Very rare May involve a gene called APOE E4 Usually caused by gene changes passed down from parent to childLate-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseShare this infographic and help spread the word about Alzheimer&aposs genetics. Most people with Alzheimer&aposs have the late-onset form of the disease, in which symptoms become apparent in the mid-60s.Researchers have not found a specific gene that directly causes the late-onset form of the disease. However, one genetic risk factor-having one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on chromosome 19-does increase a person&aposs risk. APOE comes in several different forms, or alleles:- APOE E2 is relatively rare and may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE E4 gene. - APOE E3, the most common allele, is believed to play a neutral role in the disease-neither decreasing nor increasing risk. - APOE E4 increases risk for Alzheimer&aposs disease and is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset. A person has zero, one, or two APOE E4 alleles. Having more APOE E4 alleles increases the risk of developing Alzheimer&aposs.APOE E4 is called a risk-factor gene because it increases a person&aposs risk of developing the disease. However, inheriting an APOE E4 allele does not mean that a person will definitely develop Alzheimer&aposs. Some people with an APOE E4 allele never get the disease, and others who develop Alzheimer&aposs do not have any APOE E4 alleles.Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseEarly-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs between a person&aposs 30s to mid-60s and represents less than 10 percent of all people with Alzheimer&aposs. Some cases are caused by an inherited change in one of three genes, resulting in a type known as early-onset familial Alzheimer&aposs disease, or FAD. For other cases of early-onset Alzheimer&aposs, research suggests there may be a genetic component related to factors other than these three genes.A child whose biological mother or father carries a genetic mutation for early-onset FAD has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is in fact inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing early-onset FAD.Early-onset FAD is caused by any one of a number of different single gene mutations on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. Each of these mutations causes abnormal proteins to be formed. Mutations on chromosome 21 cause the formation of abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP). A mutation on chromosome 14 causes abnormal presenilin 1 to be made, and a mutation on chromosome 1 leads to abnormal presenilin 2.Each of these mutations plays a role in the breakdown of APP, a protein whose precise function is not yet fully understood. This breakdown is part of a process that generates harmful forms of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer&aposs disease. Research suggests that a host of factors beyond genetics may play a role in the development and course of Alzheimer&aposs disease. There is a great deal of interest, for example, in the relationship between cognitive decline and vascular conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure, as well as metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Ongoing research will help us understand whether and how reducing risk factors for these conditions may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer&aposs.A nutritious diet, physical activity, social engagement, and mentally stimulating pursuits have all been associated with helping people stay healthy as they age. These factors might also help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer&aposs disease. Clinical trials are testing some of these possibilities. Scientists believe that many factors influence when Alzheimer&aposs disease begins and how it progresses. The more they study this devastating disease, the more they realize that genes play an important role. Research conducted and funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and others is advancing our understanding of Alzheimer&aposs disease genetics.

When a genetic variant increases disease risk but does not directly cause a disease, it is called a genetic risk factor.Identifying genetic variants may help researchers find the most effective ways to treat or prevent diseases such as Alzheimer&aposs in an individual. This approach, called precision medicine, takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person. Alzheimer&aposs disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease. It is characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles; the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain; and the death of these nerve cells. There are two types of Alzheimer&aposs-early-onset and late-onset. Both types have a genetic component.What Are DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes? The nucleus of almost every human cell contains a "blueprint" that carries the instructions a cell needs to do its job. The blueprint is made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is present in long strands that would stretch to nearly 6 feet in length if attached end to end. The DNA is packed tightly together with proteins into compact structures called chromosomes. Normally, each cell has 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs, which are inherited equally from a person&aposs biological parents. The DNA in nearly all cells of an individual is identical. Each chromosome contains many thousands of segments, called genes. People inherit two copies of each gene from their parents, except for genes on the X and Y chromosomes, which, among other functions, determine a person&aposs sex. The genes "instruct" the cell to make unique proteins that, in turn, dictate the types of cells made. Genes also direct almost every aspect of the cell&aposs construction, operation, and repair. Even slight changes in a gene can produce a protein that functions abnormally, which may lead to disease. Other changes in genes may increase or decrease a person&aposs risk of developing a particular disease.Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseEarly-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs between a person&aposs 30s to mid-60s and represents less than 10 percent of all people with Alzheimer&aposs. Some cases are caused by an inherited change in one of three genes, resulting in a type known as early-onset familial Alzheimer&aposs disease, or FAD. For other cases of early-onset Alzheimer&aposs, research suggests there may be a genetic component related to factors other than these three genes.A child whose biological mother or father carries a genetic mutation for early-onset FAD has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is in fact inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing early-onset FAD.Early-onset FAD is caused by any one of a number of different single-gene mutations on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. Each of these mutations causes abnormal proteins to be formed. Mutations on chromosome 21 cause the formation of abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP). A mutation on chromosome 14 causes abnormal presenilin 1 to be made, and a mutation on chromosome 1 leads to abnormal presenilin 2.Each of these mutations plays a role in the breakdown of APP, a protein whose precise function is not yet fully understood. This breakdown is part of a process that generates harmful forms of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease.Critical research findings about early-onset Alzheimer&aposs have helped identify key steps in the formation of brain abnormalities typical of the more common late-onset form of Alzheimer&aposs. Genetics studies have helped explain why the disease develops in people at various ages.NIA-supported scientists are continuing research into early-onset disease through the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), an international partnership to study families with early-onset FAD. By observing the Alzheimer&aposs-related brain changes that occur in these families long before symptoms of memory loss or cognitive issues appear, scientists hope to gain insight into how and why the disease develops in both its early- and late-onset forms.In addition, an NIA-supported clinical trial in Colombia, South America, is testing the effectiveness of an amyloid-clearing drug in symptom-free volunteers at high risk of developing early-onset FAD.For more information, see NIA&aposs Early-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Disease: A Resource List.Late-Onset Alzheimer&aposs DiseaseMost people with Alzheimer&aposs have the late-onset form of the disease, in which symptoms become apparent in the mid-60s and later. The causes of late-onset Alzheimer&aposs are not yet completely understood, but they likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that affect a person&aposs risk for developing the disease.Researchers have not found a specific gene that directly causes the late-onset form of the disease. However, one genetic risk factor-having one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on chromosome 19-does increase a person&aposs risk. APOE comes in several different forms, or alleles:- APOE epsilon2 is relatively rare and may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer&aposs disease occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE epsilon4 gene. - APOE epsilon3, the most common allele, is believed to play a neutral role in the disease-neither decreasing nor increasing risk. - APOE epsilon4 increases risk for Alzheimer&aposs disease and is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset. A person has zero, one, or two APOE epsilon4 alleles. Having more APOE epsilon4 alleles increases the risk of developing Alzheimer&aposs.APOE epsilon4 is called a risk-factor gene because it increases a person&aposs risk of developing the disease. However, inheriting an APOE epsilon4 allele does not mean that a person will definitely develop Alzheimer&aposs. Some people with an APOE epsilon4 allele never get the disease, and others who develop Alzheimer&aposs do not have any APOE epsilon4 alleles.Using a relatively new approach called genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers have identified a number of regions of interest in the genome (an organism&aposs complete set of DNA, including all of its genes) that may increase a person&aposs risk for late-onset Alzheimer&aposs to varying degrees. By 2015, they had confirmed 33 regions of interest in the Alzheimer&aposs genome.A method called whole genome sequencing determines the complete DNA sequence of a person&aposs genome at a single time. Another method called whole exome sequencing looks at the parts of the genome that directly code for the proteins. Using these two approaches, researchers can identify new genes that contribute to or protect against disease risk. Recent discoveries have led to new insights about biological pathways involved in Alzheimer&aposs and may one day lead to effective interventions. A blood test can identify which APOE alleles a person has, but results cannot predict who will or will not develop Alzheimer&aposs disease. It is unlikely that genetic testing will ever be able to predict the disease with 100 percent accuracy, researchers believe, because too many other factors may influence its development and progression.Currently, APOE testing is used in research settings to identify study participants who may have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer&aposs. This knowledge helps scientists look for early brain changes in participants and compare the effectiveness of treatments for people with different APOE profiles. Most researchers believe that APOE testing is useful for studying Alzheimer&aposs disease risk in large groups of people but not for determining any one person&aposs risk.Genetic testing is used by researchers conducting clinical trials and by physicians to help diagnose early-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. However, genetic testing is not otherwise recommended.Epigenetics: Nature Meets Nurture Scientists have long thought that genetic and environmental factors interact to influence a person&aposs biological makeup, including the predisposition to different diseases. More recently, they have discovered the biological mechanisms for those interactions. The expression of genes (when particular genes are "switched" on or off) can be affected-positively and negatively-by environmental factors at any time in life. These factors include exercise, diet, chemicals, or smoking, to which an individual may be exposed, even in the womb. Epigenetics is an emerging science focused on how and when particular genes are turned on or off. Diet and exposure to chemicals in the environment, among other factors, can alter a cell&aposs DNA in ways that affect the activity of genes. That can make people more or less susceptible to developing a disease. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to Alzheimer&aposs disease. Epigenetic changes, whether protective, benign, or harmful, may help explain, for example, why one family member develops the disease and another does not. Scientists are learning more about Alzheimer&aposs-related epigenetics, with the hope of developing individualized treatments based on epigenetic markers and their function. Discovering all that we can about the role of Alzheimer&aposs disease genetic risk and protective factors is an important area of research. Understanding more about the genetic basis of the disease will help researchers to:- Answer a number of basic questions-What makes the disease process begin? Why do some people with memory and other thinking problems develop Alzheimer&aposs while others do not? - Determine how genetic risk and protective factors may interact with other genes and lifestyle or environmental factors to affect Alzheimer&aposs risk in any one person. - Identify people who are at high risk for developing Alzheimer&aposs so they can benefit from new interventions and treatments as soon as possible. - Focus on new prevention and treatment approaches.Major Alzheimer&aposs Genetics Research Efforts Underway The National Institute on Aging supports several major genetics research programs. - The Alzheimer&aposs Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is an innovative collaboration between NIA and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both part of NIH. The first phase of the project determined the order of all 3 billion letters in the individual genomes of 580 participants. It also generated whole exome sequencing data for an additional 11,000 volunteers. - The Alzheimer&aposs Disease Genetics Consortium is a collaborative effort to collect and analyze genetic data from thousands of families around the world to identify genes associated with an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer&aposs. - The Late-Onset Alzheimer&aposs Disease Genetics Study is gathering and analyzing genetic and other information from 1,500 or more families in the United States with two or more members who have late-onset Alzheimer&aposs. - The International Genomic Alzheimer&aposs Project (IGAP) is comprised of four consortia in the United States and Europe that have been working together since 2011 on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving thousands of DNA samples and shared data sets. In a study of more than 74,000 individuals, IGAP recently reported the identification of 19 novel regions of interest that are associated with the disease. - The Genetics of Alzheimer&aposs Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) is a national genetics data repository that gives investigators access to data to study the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. - The National Cell Repository for Alzheimer&aposs Disease (NCRAD) is a national resource that helps researchers find genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer&aposs by providing biological samples and data. Volunteers are critical to Alzheimer&aposs disease genetics research. The more genetic information that researchers can gather and analyze from individuals and families-both healthy volunteers and those who may be at risk-the more clues they will have for finding additional risk-factor genes. To learn more about Alzheimer&aposs genetics studies, contact NCRAD toll-free at 1-800-526-2839 or visit http://ncrad.iu.edu. - Allele-A form of a gene. Each person receives two alleles of a gene, one from each biological parent. This combination is one factor among many that influence a variety of processes in the body. On chromosome 19, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has three common alleles: epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4. - Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene-A gene on chromosome 19 involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. The APOE epsilon4 allele is the major known risk-factor gene for late-onset Alzheimer&aposs disease. - Chromosome-A compact structure containing DNA and proteins present in nearly all cells of the body. Chromosomes carry genes, which direct the cell to make proteins and direct a cell&aposs construction, operation, and repair. Normally, each cell has 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Each biological parent contributes one of each pair of chromosomes. - DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)-The hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Almost all cells in a person&aposs body have the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus. - Gene-A basic unit of heredity. Genes direct a cell to make proteins and guide almost every aspect of a cell&aposs construction, operation, and repair. - Genetic mutation-A permanent change in a gene that can be passed on to children. The rare, early-onset familial form of Alzheimer&aposs disease is associated with mutations in genes on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. - Genetic risk factor-A change in a gene that increases a person&aposs risk of developing a disease. - Genetic variant-A change in a gene that may increase or decrease a person&aposs risk of developing a disease or condition. - Genome-An organism&aposs complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain that organism. - Genome-wide association study (GWAS)-A study approach that involves rapidly scanning the genomes of many individuals to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease. - Protein-A substance that determines the physical and chemical characteristics of a cell and therefore of an organism. Proteins are essential to all cell functions and are created using genetic information.

-1.77777777778	how is congenital heart disease passed down	Facts About Color Blindness (How Genes are Inherited): Genes are bundled together on structures called chromosomes. One copy of each chromosome is passed by a parent at conception through egg and sperm cells. The X and Y chromosomes, known as sex chromosomes, determine whether a person is born female (XX) or male (XY) and also carry other traits not related to gender. In X-linked inheritance, the mother carries the mutated gene on one of her X chromosomes and will pass on the mutated gene to 50 percent of her children. Because females have two X chromosomes, the effect of a mutation on one X chromosome is offset by the normal gene on the other X chromosome. In this case the mother will not have the disease, but she can pass on the mutated gene and so is called a carrier. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked disease (and the father is not affected), there is a: - 1 in 2 chance that a son will have the disease, - 1 in 2 chance that a daughter will be a carrier of the disease, - No chance that a daughter will have the disease. In autosomal recessive inheritance, it takes two copies of the mutant gene to give rise to the disease. An individual who has one copy of a recessive gene mutation is known as a carrier. When two carriers have a child, there is a: - 1 in 4 chance of having a child with the disease, - 1 in 2 chance of having a child who is a carrier, - 1 in 4 chance of having a child who neither has the disease nor is a carrier. In autosomal dominant inheritance, it takes just one copy of the mutant gene to bring about the disease. When an affected parent with one dominant gene mutation has a child, there is a 1 in 2 chance that a child will inherit the disease.
0.777777777778	how is congenital heart disease passed down	Congenital heart disease (Causes): Congenital heart disease can describe a number of different problems affecting the heart. It is the most common type of birth defect. CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects. Congenital heart disease is often divided into 2 types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common congenital heart diseases: Cyanotic: - Ebstein&aposs anomaly - Hypoplastic left heart - Pulmonary atresia - Tetralogy of Fallot - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return - Transposition of the great vessels - Tricuspid atresia - Truncus arteriosus Non-cyanotic: - Aortic stenosis - Atrial septal defect (ASD) - Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect) - Coarctation of the aorta - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - Pulmonic stenosis - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) These problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families. Examples include: - DiGeorge syndrome - Down syndrome - Marfan syndrome - Noonan syndrome - Trisomy 13 - Turner syndrome Often, no cause for the heart disease can be found. Congenital heart diseases continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems. Poorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to a high rate of congenital heart defects.
0.888888888889	how is congenital heart disease passed down	critical congenital heart disease (Genetic Changes): In most cases, the cause of CCHD is unknown. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition. Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD. Studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth. Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD. However, it is unclear whether genes affected by copy number variation are involved in heart development and how having missing or extra copies of those genes could lead to heart defects. Researchers believe that single-gene mutations and copy number variation account for a relatively small percentage of all CCHD. CCHD is usually isolated, which means it occurs alone (without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body). However, the heart defects associated with CCHD can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. Some of these genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes. Other conditions, including Noonan syndrome and Alagille syndrome, result from mutations in single genes. Environmental factors may also contribute to the development of CCHD. Potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria. Although researchers are examining risk factors that may be associated with this complex condition, many of these factors remain unknown.
-0.444444444444	how is congenital heart disease passed down	Congenital heart disease (Prevention): Women who are pregnant should get good prenatal care: - Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy. - Tell your health care provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines. - Have a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery. - Pregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level. Certain genes may play a role in congenital heart disease. Many family members may be affected. Talk to your provider about genetic counseling and screening if you have a family history of cogenital heart disease.
2.0	how is congenital heart disease passed down	critical congenital heart disease (Inheritance Pattern): Most cases of CCHD are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, close relatives (such as siblings) of people with CCHD may have an increased risk of being born with a heart defect compared with people in the general population.
-1.88888888889	how is congenital heart disease passed down	Genetics: Genetics is the study of heredity, the process of a parent passing certain genes to their children. A person&aposs appearance -- height, hair color, skin color, and eye color -- is determined by genes. Other characteristics affected by heredity are: - Likelihood of getting certain diseases - Mental abilities - Natural talents An abnormal trait (anomaly) that is passed down through families (inherited) may: - Have no effect on your health or well-being. For example, the trait might just cause a white patch of hair or an earlobe that is longer than normal. - Have only a minor effect, such as color blindness. - Have a major effect on your quality or length of life. For most genetic disorders, genetic counseling is advised. Many couples may also want to seek prenatal diagnosis if one of them has a genetic disorder. Human beings have cells with 46 chromosomes. These consist of 2 chromosomes that determine what sex they are (X and Y chromosomes), and 22 pairs of nonsex (autosomal) chromosomes. Males are "46,XY" and females are "46,XX." The chromosomes are made up of strands of genetic information called DNA. Each chromosome contains sections of DNA called genes. The genes carry the information needed by your body to make certain proteins. Each pair of autosomal chromosomes contains one chromosome from the mother and one from the father. Each chromosome in a pair carries basically the same information; that is, each chromosome pair has the same genes. Sometimes there are slight variations of these genes. These variations occur in less than 1% of the DNA sequence. The genes that have these variations are called alleles. Some of these variations can result in a gene that is abnormal. An abnormal gene may lead to an abnormal protein or an abnormal amount of a normal protein. In a pair of autosomal chromosomes, there are two copies of each gene, one from each parent. If one of these genes is abnormal, the other one may make enough protein so that no disease develops. When this happens, the abnormal gene is called recessive, and the other gene in the pair is called dominant. Recessive genes are said to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. However, if only one abnormal gene is needed to produce a disease, it leads to a dominant hereditary disorder. In the case of a dominant disorder, if one abnormal gene is inherited from the mother or father, the child will likely show the disease. A person with one abnormal gene is called heterozygous for that gene. If a child receives an abnormal recessive disease gene from both parents, the child will show the disease and will be homozygous (or compound heterozygous) for that gene. GENETIC DISORDERS Almost all diseases have a genetic component. However, the importance of that component varies. Disorders in which genes play an important role (genetic diseases) can be classified as: - Single-gene defects - Chromosomal disorders - Multifactorial A single-gene disorder (also called Mendelian disorder) is caused by a defect in one particular gene. Single gene defects are rare. But since there are many thousands of known single gene disorders, their combined impact is significant. Single-gene disorders are characterized by how they are passed down in families. There are 6 basic patterns of single gene inheritance: - Autosomal dominant - Autosomal recessive - X-linked dominant - X-linked recessive - Y-linked inheritance - Maternal (mitochondrial) inheritance The observed effect of a gene (the appearance of a disorder) is called the phenotype. In autosomal dominant inheritance, the abnormality or abnormalities usually appear in every generation. Each time an affected woman has a child, that child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. People with one copy of a recessive disease gene are called carriers. Carriers usually don&apost have symptoms of the disease. But, the gene can often be found by sensitive laboratory tests. In autosomal recessive inheritance, the parents of an affected individual may not show the disease (they are carriers). On average, the chance that carrier parents could have children who develop the disease is 25% with each pregnancy. Male and female children are equally likely to be affected. For a child to have symptoms of an autosomal recessive disorder, the child must receive the abnormal gene from both parents. Because most recessive disorders are rare, a child is at increased risk of a recessive disease if the parents are related. Related individuals are more likely to have inherited the same rare gene from a common ancestor. In X-linked recessive inheritance, the chance of getting the disease is much higher in males than females. Since the abnormal gene is carried on the X (female) chromosome, males do not transmit it to their sons (who will receive the Y chromosome from their fathers). However, they do transmit it to their daughters. In females, the presence of one normal X chromosome masks the effects of the X chromosome with the abnormal gene. So, almost all of the daughters of an affected man appear normal, but they are all carriers of the abnormal gene. Each time these daughters bear a son, there is a 50% chance the son will receive the abnormal gene. In X-linked dominant inheritance, the abnormal gene appears in females even if there is also a normal X chromosome present. Since males pass the Y chromosome to their sons, affected males will not have affected sons. All of their daughters will be affected, however. Sons or daughters of affected females will have a 50% chance of getting the disease. EXAMPLES OF SINGLE GENE DISORDERS Autosomal recessive: - ADA deficiency (sometimes called the "boy in a bubble" disease) - Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency - Cystic fibrosis (CF) - Phenylketonuria (PKU) - Sickle cell anemia X-linked recessive: - Duchenne muscular dystrophy - Hemophilia A Autosomal dominant: - Familial hypercholesterolemia - Huntington disease X-linked dominant: Only a few, rare, disorders are X-linked dominant. One of these is hypophosphatemic rickets, also called vitamin D -resistant rickets. CHROMOSOMAL DISORDERS In chromosomal disorders, the defect is due to either an excess or lack of the genes contained in a whole chromosome or chromosome segment. Chromosomal disorders include: - 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome - Down syndrome - Klinefelter syndrome - Turner syndrome MULTIFACTORIAL DISORDERS Many of the most common diseases are caused by interactions of several genes and factors in the the environment (for example, illnesses in the mother and medications). These include: - Asthma - Cancer - Coronary heart disease - Diabetes - Hypertension - Stroke MITOCHONDRIAL DNA-LINKED DISORDERS Mitochondria are small structures found in most of the body&aposs cells. They are responsible for energy production inside cells. Mitochondria contain their own private DNA. In recent years, many disorders have been shown to result from changes (mutations) in mitochondrial DNA. Because mitochondria come only from the female egg, most mitochondrial DNA-related disorders are passed down from the mother. Mitochondrial DNA-related disorders can appear at any age. They have a wide variety of symptoms and signs. These disorders may cause: - Blindness - Developmental delay - Gastrointestinal problems - Hearing loss - Heart rhythm problems - Metabolic disturbances - Short stature Some other disorders are also known as mitochondrial disorders, but they do not involve mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. These disorders are most often single gene defects. They follow the same pattern of inheritance as other single gene disorders. Most are autosomal recessive.

-0.555555555556	how is congenital heart disease passed down	Congenital heart disease in adults: Congenital mitral valve anomalies are defects present at birth (congenital) that affect the heart&aposs mitral valve. The mitral valve is located between the heart&aposs upper left chamber (left atrium) and lower left chamber (left ventricle). Various types of mitral valve anomalies exist, including: - Thickened, stiffened, deformed or fused valve flaps (leaflets) - Abnormalities with the cords that support the valve, such as short and thick cords, cords attaching to a heart muscle near the mitral valve, or missing cords - Heart tissue or heart muscle problems near the mitral valve These mitral valve anomalies can cause the mitral valve to not function normally. Some mitral valve anomalies may lead to mitral valve stenosis, in which the flaps become thick or stiff or fuse together. This causes a narrowed valve opening and reduced blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Other mitral valve anomalies may lead to mitral valve regurgitation, in which the flaps don&apost close tightly, causing blood to leak backward into the left atrium. Mitral valve regurgitation may also be caused by the flaps bulging backward into the left atrium as your heart contracts (mitral valve prolapse). In some cases, people may have both mitral valve stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation. Some people may have more than one opening in the area of the mitral valve, a condition called double-orifice mitral valve. In these people, one or both of the openings is often either narrowed (stenotic) or leaking (regurgitant). People with mitral valve anomalies also often have additional congenital heart defects. Your doctor may review your signs and symptoms, discuss your medical and family history, and conduct a physical exam. Your doctor may listen to your heart with a stethoscope to check for a heart murmur, which can be a sign of mitral valve disease. Congenital mitral valve anomalies are often diagnosed with an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce video images of your heart in motion. This test can show the structure of the heart, the heart valves and blood flow through the heart. Doctors may use this test to evaluate whether mitral valve stenosis or mitral valve regurgitation is present. Other tests, such as a chest X-ray or electrocardiogram, may also be conducted. Congenital heart disease (congenital heart defect) is one or more abnormalities in your heart&aposs structure that you&aposre born with. This most common of birth defects can alter the way blood flows through your heart. Defects range from simple, which might cause no problems, to complex, which can cause life-threatening complications. Advances in diagnosis and treatment mean most babies who once died of congenital heart disease survive well into adulthood. However, signs and symptoms of the condition can occur in adults later in life, even those who had treatment as a child. If you have congenital heart disease you might need care throughout your life. Check with your doctor to determine how often you should be seen as an adult. Adult congenital heart disease care at Mayo Clinic Some congenital heart defects cause no signs or symptoms. For some people, signs or symptoms occur later in life. They can recur years after you&aposve had treatment for a heart defect. Common congenital heart disease symptoms you might have as an adult include: - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) - A bluish tint to the skin, lips and fingernails (cyanosis) - Shortness of breath - Tiring quickly upon exertion - Swelling of body tissue or organs (edema) If you&aposre having worrisome symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, seek emergency medical attention. If you have signs or symptoms of congenital heart disease or were treated for a congenital heart defect as a child, make an appointment to see your doctor. Researchers aren&apost sure what causes most congenital heart disease, which develops in the womb. Heredity might play a role in some congenital heart disease. The heart is divided into two chambers on the right and two on the left. To pump blood through the body, the heart uses its left and right sides differently. The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through certain blood vessels (pulmonary arteries). In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side through the pulmonary veins. The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body. Congenital heart disease can affect any of the heart&aposs structures, including valves, chambers, the wall of tissue that separates the chambers (septum) and arteries. For some adults, problems with their heart defects arise later in life, even if treated in childhood. Repairing defects improves heart function, but might not make the heart completely normal. Even if the treatment you received in childhood was successful, a problem can occur or worsen as you age. It&aposs also possible that problems in your heart, which weren&apost serious enough to repair when you were a child, have worsened and now require treatment. Then there are complications of childhood surgeries to correct congenital heart disease that can occur later, such as scar tissue in your heart that contributes to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Certain environmental and genetic risk factors might play a role in the development of your heart defect, including: - German measles (rubella). Your mother having had rubella while pregnant could have affected your heart development. - Diabetes. Your mother having type 1 or type 2 diabetes might have interfered with the development of your heart. Gestational diabetes generally doesn&apost increase the risk of developing a heart defect. - Medications. Taking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart and other birth defects. They include isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others), used to treat acne; and lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder. Drinking alcohol while pregnant also contributes to the risk of heart defects. - Heredity. Congenital heart disease appears to run in families and is associated with many genetic syndromes. For instance, children with Down syndrome often have heart defects. Genetic testing can detect Down syndrome and other disorders during a baby&aposs development. - Smoking. A mother who smokes while pregnant increases her risk of having a child with a congenital heart defect. To determine whether you have a type of congenital heart disease or if the congenital heart defect is causing recent health problems, your doctor will take a medical history and conduct a physical exam, including listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Your doctor then might order tests, including: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This measures the pace and amount of electrical activity of your heart to determine if the electrical activity is normal. An ECG can determine if a part of the heart is enlarged. - Chest X-ray. These images help your doctor further evaluate your heart and lungs. - Echocardiogram. Sound waves (ultrasound) produce images of the moving heart that your doctor can use to identify heart abnormalities. - Transesophageal echocardiogram. This special type of ultrasound produces images of your heart that provide more information than does a standard echocardiogram. While you&aposre sedated, your doctor places an instrument with a small ultrasound probe on the end into the tube that connects your throat with your stomach (esophagus). - Pulse oximetry. A small sensor attached to a finger can estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. - Exercise stress test. Connected to ECG leads, you exercise on a treadmill or a stationary bicycle so that your doctor can determine your level of conditioning and your heart&aposs electrical activity, heart rate and blood pressure during exercise. If you can&apost exercise, your doctor might give you medication to increase your heart rate. Your stress test may also include an echocardiogram and special sensors to determine your oxygen use. - Cardiac CT scan or MRI. For a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest. Cardiac MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of your heart. You lie on a table inside a long tubelike machine. - Cardiac catheterization. Your doctor might use this test to check blood flow and blood pressures in your heart. You&aposll likely be given sleeping medication before a catheter is inserted into an artery, starting in your groin, neck or arm. It&aposs then threaded to your heart with guidance from an X-ray machine. Dye is injected through the catheter, and the X-ray machine makes images of your heart and blood vessels. The pressure in the heart chambers can be measured during this procedure. Depending on the severity of your congenital heart disease, treatment might be aimed at correcting the congenital heart defect or dealing with complications caused by the defect. Treatment might include: - Watchful waiting. Relatively minor heart defects might require only periodic checkups with your doctor to make sure your condition doesn&apost worsen. Ask your doctor how often you need to be seen. - Medications. Some mild congenital heart defects can be treated with medications that help the heart work more efficiently. You might also need medications to prevent blood clots or to control an irregular heartbeat. - Implantable heart devices. Devices that help control your heart rate (pacemaker) or that correct life-threatening irregular heartbeats (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD) can help some of the complications associated with congenital heart defects. - Special procedures using catheters. Some congenital heart defects can be repaired using catheterization techniques, which allow the repair to be done without surgically opening the chest and heart. In these procedures, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a leg vein and guides it to the heart with the help of X-ray images. Once the catheter is in position, the doctor threads tiny tools through the catheter to repair the defect. - Open-heart surgery. If catheter procedures can&apost fix your heart defect, your doctor might recommend open-heart surgery. - Heart transplant. If a serious heart defect can&apost be repaired, a heart transplant might be an option. Needed follow-up care Many adults with congenital heart disease believe they&aposve either outgrown their condition or that childhood treatment cured them. This might not be true, depending on the type of defect. If you have congenital heart disease, even if you had surgery as a child, you&aposre at risk of developing complications. So it&aposs important to have lifelong follow-up care, especially if you had corrective heart surgery. This follow-up care could be as simple as having periodic checkups with your doctor, or it may involve regular screenings for complications. The important thing is to discuss your care plan with your doctor and make sure you follow all of your doctor&aposs recommendations. Ideally, a cardiologist trained in treating adults with congenital heart defects will manage your care. Congenital heart disease and pregnancy A successful pregnancy is possible if you have congenital heart disease, especially if your defect was mild. However, some women with complex congenital heart defects are advised against pregnancy. Before you become pregnant, discuss with your doctor possible risks and special care you might need during pregnancy. Both men and women with congenital heart disease are at increased risk of passing some form of congenital heart disease to their children. Your doctor might suggest genetic counseling if you plan to become pregnant.
2.0	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	Trisomy 18 (Exams and Tests): An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone. Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation. Other signs include: - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma) - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti) - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as: - Atrial septal defect (ASD) - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tests may also show kidney problems, including: - Horseshoe kidney - Hydronephrosis - Polycystic kidney
-1.7	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	What is Down syndrome?: Down syndrome is a chromosome disorder associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and low muscle tone in infancy. The degree of intellectual disability varies from mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may also be born with various health concerns such as heart defects or digestive abnormalities. They also have an increased risk to develop gastroesophageal reflux, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hearing and vision problems, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21) instead of the usual two copies and is typically not inherited. Treatment focuses on the specific symptoms in each person.
-0.2	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	Trisomy 18 (Prevention): Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome. Genetic testing is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.
-1.8	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	What is Down syndrome?: Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition that is associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy. All affected individuals experience cognitive delays, but the intellectual disability is usually mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may have a variety of birth defects. About half of all affected children are born with a heart defect. Digestive abnormalities, such as a blockage of the intestine, are less common. Individuals with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing several medical conditions. These include gastroesophageal reflux, which is a backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus, and celiac disease, which is an intolerance of a wheat protein called gluten. About 15 percent of people with Down syndrome have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ in the lower neck that produces hormones. Individuals with Down syndrome also have an increased risk of hearing and vision problems. Additionally, a small percentage of children with Down syndrome develop cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia). Delayed development and behavioral problems are often reported in children with Down syndrome. Affected individuals&apos speech and language develop later and more slowly than in children without Down syndrome, and affected individuals&apos speech may be more difficult to understand. Behavioral issues can include attention problems, obsessive/compulsive behavior, and stubbornness or tantrums. A small percentage of people with Down syndrome are also diagnosed with developmental conditions called autism spectrum disorders, which affect communication and social interaction. People with Down syndrome often experience a gradual decline in thinking ability (cognition) as they age, usually starting around age 50. Down syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Approximately half of adults with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer disease. Although Alzheimer disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, people with Down syndrome usually develop this condition in their fifties or sixties.
0.9	how is edward&aposs syndrome diagnosed	Trisomy 18: Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from chromosome 18, instead of the usual 2 copies. Trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6,000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys. The syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development. Symptoms may include: - Clenched hands - Crossed legs - Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet) - Low birth weight - Low-set ears - Mental delay - Poorly developed fingernails - Small head (microcephaly) - Small jaw (micrognathia) - Undescended testicle - Unusual shaped chest (pectus carinatum) An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone. Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation. Other signs include: - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma) - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti) - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as: - Atrial septal defect (ASD) - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tests may also show kidney problems, including: - Horseshoe kidney - Hydronephrosis - Polycystic kidney There are no specific treatments for trisomy 18. Which treatments are used depend on the person&aposs individual condition. Support groups include: - Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders (SOFT): trisomy.org - Trisomy 18 Foundation: www.trisomy18.org - Hope for Trisomy 13 and 18: www.hopefortrisomy13and18.org Half of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. Nine out of 10 children will die by 1 year of age. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems. Complications depend on the specific defects and symptoms. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the person. Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome. Genetic testing is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.

-0.3	how is epidural harmful	Epidural block - pregnancy (How is the Epidural Given?): The block or shot is given into an area over your lower back or spine. - You may be asked to lie on your side, or you may sit up. - Either way, you will be asked to pull your stomach inwards and hunch your back outwards. Your health care provider will wash the area of your back and inject a little medicine to numb the spot where the epidural needle is placed: - The provider inserts a needle into your lower back. - The needle is placed into a small space outside your spinal cord. - A small soft tube (catheter) is placed into your back, next to your spine. - The needle is removed. The numbing medicine is given through the tube for as long as it is needed. In most cases, you will receive a low dose because it is safer for you and baby. Once the medicine takes effect (10 to 20 minutes), you should feel better. You may still feel some back or rectal pressure during contractions. You may shiver after an epidural, but this is common. Many women shiver during labor even without an epidural.
-1.5	how is epidural harmful	How to diagnose Epidural abscess?: The health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for a loss of functions, such as movement or sensation. Tests that may be done include: - Blood cultures - Complete blood count (CBC) - CT scan of head or spine - Draining of abscess and examination of the material - MRI of head or spine
-1.6	how is epidural harmful	Epidural abscess: An epidural abscess is a collection of pus (infected material) and germs between the outer covering of the brain and spinal cord and the bones of the skull or spine. The abscess causes swelling in the area. Epidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine. The spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria, but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found. An abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following: - Chronic ear infections - Chronic sinusitis - Head injury - Mastoiditis - Recent neurosurgery An abscess of the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess. It may be seen in people with any of the following: - Had back surgery or another invasive procedure involving the spine - Bloodstream infections - Boils, especially on the back or scalp - Bone infections of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis) People who inject drugs are also at increased risk. Spinal epidural abscess may cause these symptoms: - Bowel or bladder incontinence - Difficulty urinating (urinary retention) - Fever and back pain Intracranial epidural abscess may cause these symptoms: - Fever - Headache - Lethargy - Nausea and vomiting - Pain at the site of recent surgery that gets worse (especially if fever is present) Nervous system symptoms depend on the location of the abscess and may include: - Decreased ability to move any part of the body - Loss of sensation in any area of the body, or abnormal changes in sensation - Weakness The health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for a loss of functions, such as movement or sensation. Tests that may be done include: - Blood cultures to check for bacteria in the blood - Complete blood count (CBC) - CT scan of head or spine - Draining of abscess and examination of the material - MRI of head or spine - Urine analysis and culture The goal of treatment is to cure the infection and reduce the risk of permanent damage. Treatment usually includes antibiotics and surgery. In some cases, antibiotics alone are used. Antibiotics are usually given through a vein (IV) for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some people need to take them for a longer time, depending on the type of bacteria and how severe the disease is. Surgery may be needed to drain or remove the abscess. Surgery is also often needed to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or brain, if there is weakness or damage to the nerves. Early diagnosis and treatment greatly improves the chance of a good outcome. Once weakness, paralysis, or sensation changes occur, the chance of recovering lost function is greatly reduced. Permanent nervous system damage or death may occur. Complications may include: - Brain abscess - Brain damage - Bone infection (osteomyelitis) - Chronic back pain - Meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) - Nerve damage - Return of infection - Spinal cord abscess An epidural abscess is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of spinal cord abscess. Treatment of certain infections, such as ear infections, sinusitis, and bloodstream infections, may decrease the risk of an epidural abscess. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications. Updated by: Jatin M.

0.9	how is epidural harmful	Epidural block - pregnancy (Is an Epidural Safe?): Many studies have shown that an epidural is a safe way to manage pain during childbirth. While rare, there are some risks. Your blood pressure may drop for a short while. This might cause the baby&aposs heart rate to slow down. - To avoid this, you will receive fluids through an intravenous (IV) line to help keep your blood pressure stable. - If your blood pressure shows a drop, you may need to lie on your side to keep the blood moving throughout your body. - Your provider may also give you medicine to raise your blood pressure. An epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery. - If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal. - Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your doctor can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed. Other rare side effects are: - You may get a headache after your epidural but this is rare. - Medicine could enter your spinal fluid. For a short while, it could make you feel dizzy, or you might have a hard time breathing. You could also have a seizure. This is also rare.
0.8	how is epidural harmful	Epidural block - pregnancy: An epidural block is a numbing medicine given by injection (shot) in the back. It numbs or causes a loss of feeling in the lower half your body. This lessens the pain of contractions during childbirth. An epidural block may also be used to reduce pain during surgery on the lower extremities. This article focuses on epidural blocks during childbirth. The block or shot is given into an area over your lower back or spine. - You may be asked to lie on your side, or you may sit up. - Either way, you will be asked to pull your stomach inwards and hunch your back outwards.

This type of epidural will lessen your pain, but you will still be able to move your legs. Most women are not really able to walk around, but they can move their legs. - Combined spinal epidural block. This combines both a spinal and epidural block. It provides pain relief much faster. The combined block is used when women are in very active labor and want relief right away. Updated by: Laura J.

2.0	how is epidural harmful	Spinal and epidural anesthesia: Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You&aposll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

-1.7	how is epidural harmful	Epidural hematoma: An epidural hematoma (EDH) is bleeding between the inside of the skull and the outer covering of the brain (called the dura). An EDH is often caused by a skull fracture during childhood or adolescence. This type of bleeding is more common in young people because the membrane covering the brain is not as closely attached to the skull as it is in older people and children younger than 2 years. An EDH can also occur due to rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery. The blood vessel then bleeds into the space between the dura and the skull. The affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures. The fractures are most often the result of a severe head injury, such as those caused by motorcycle or automobile accidents. Rapid bleeding causes a collection of blood (hematoma) that presses on the brain. The pressure inside the head (intracranial pressure, ICP) increases quickly. This pressure may result in more brain injury. Contact a health care provider for any head injury that results in even a brief loss of consciousness, or if there are any other symptoms after a head injury (even without loss of consciousness). The typical pattern of symptoms that indicate an EDH is a loss of consciousness, followed by alertness, then loss of consciousness again. But this pattern may NOT appear in all people. The most important symptoms of an EDH are: - Confusion - Dizziness - Drowsiness or altered level of alertness - Enlarged pupil in one eye - Headache (severe) - Head injury or trauma followed by loss of consciousness, a period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to unconsciousness - Nausea or vomiting - Weakness in part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil The symptoms usually occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and indicate an emergency situation. Sometimes, bleeding does not start for hours after a head injury. The symptoms of pressure on the brain also do not occur right away. The brain and nervous system (neurological) examination may show that a specific part of the brain is not working well (for instance, there may be arm weakness on one side). The exam may also indicate increased ICP. If there is increased ICP, emergency surgery may be needed to relieve the pressure and prevent further brain injury. A head CT scan will confirm the diagnosis of EDH, and will pinpoint the exact location of the hematoma and any associated skull fracture. An EDH is an emergency condition. Treatment goals include: - Taking measures to save the person&aposs life - Controlling symptoms - Minimizing or preventing permanent damage to the brain Life support measures may be required. Emergency surgery is almost always necessary to reduce pressure within the brain. This may include drilling a small hole in the skull to relieve pressure and allow blood to drain from the brain. Large hematomas or solid blood clots may need to be removed through a larger opening in the skull (craniotomy). Medicines used in addition to surgery will vary according to the type and severity of symptoms and brain damage that occurs. Antiseizure medicines may be used to control or prevent seizures. Some drugs called hyperosmotic agents may be used to reduce brain swelling. An epidural hematoma has a high risk of death without prompt surgical intervention. Even with prompt medical attention, a significant risk of death and disability remains. There is a risk of permanent brain injury, even if EDH is treated. Symptoms (such as seizures) may persist for several months, even after treatment. In time they may become less frequent or disappear. Seizures may begin up to 2 years after the injury. In adults, most recovery occurs in the first 6 months. Usually there is some improvement over 2 years. Children usually recover more quickly and fully than adults. If there is brain damage, full recovery isn&apost likely. Other complications include permanent symptoms, such as: - Herniation of the brain and permanent coma - Normal pressure hydrocephalus, which can lead to weakness, headaches, incontinence, and difficulty walking - Paralysis or loss of sensation (which began at the time of the injury) Go to the emergency room or call 911 if symptoms of epidural hematoma occur. Spinal injuries often occur with head injuries. If you must move the person before help arrives, try to keep his or her neck still. Call the provider if these symptoms persist after treatment: - Memory loss or problems focusing - Dizziness - Headache - Anxiety - Speech problems - Loss of movement in part of the body Go to the emergency room or call 911 in emergency if these symptoms develop after treatment: - Trouble breathing - Seizures - Enlarged pupils of the eyes or 2 pupils are not same size - Decreased responsiveness - Loss of consciousness An EDH may not be preventable once a head injury has occurred. To lessen the risk of head injury, use the right safety equipment (such as hard hats, bicycle or motorcycle helmets, and seat belts). Follow safety precautions at work and in sports and recreation. For example, do not dive into water if the water depth is unknown or if rocks may be present. Updated by: Amit M.

1.88888888889	how is epilepsy diagnosed	Epilepsy (Diagnosis): To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it&aposs common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you&aposre not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you&aposre awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you&aposre having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you&aposve had an MRI and EEG that didn&apost pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment.
0.666666666667	how is epilepsy diagnosed	What is Epilepsy?: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activityfrom illness to brain damage to abnormal brain developmentcan lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy.
0.555555555556	how is epilepsy diagnosed	Epilepsy - children (Exams and Tests): The provider will: - Ask about your child&aposs medical and family history in detail - Ask about the seizure episode - Do a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system The provider will order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities - Stay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG) The provider also may order other tests, including: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often, PET scan of the brain is needed to help plan surgery.
-0.666666666667	how is epilepsy diagnosed	What is Epilepsy?: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well, surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special diets can help some children with epilepsy.

1.77777777778	how is epilepsy diagnosed	Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn&apost mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age. Epilepsy care at Mayo Clinic Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they&aposre called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don&apost cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn&apost return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You&aposre experiencing heat exhaustion. - You&aposre pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You&aposve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: - Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it&aposs likely that there&aposs a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures. - Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. - Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. - Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. - Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. - Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: - Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. - Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. - Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. - Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. - Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. - Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. - Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won&apost develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it&aposs common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you&aposre not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you&aposre awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you&aposre having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you&aposve had an MRI and EEG that didn&apost pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment. Doctors generally begin by treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don&apost treat the condition, doctors may propose surgery or another type of treatment. Medication Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, which is also called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Many children with epilepsy who aren&apost experiencing epilepsy symptoms can eventually discontinue medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won&apost interact with them. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single medication at a relatively low dosage and may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Anti-seizure medications may have some side effects. Mild side effects include: - Fatigue - Dizziness - Weight gain - Loss of bone density - Skin rashes - Loss of coordination - Speech problems - Memory and thinking problems More-severe but rare side effects include: - Depression - Suicidal thoughts and behaviors - Severe rash - Inflammation of certain organs, such as your liver To achieve the best seizure control possible with medication, follow these steps: - Take medications exactly as prescribed. - Always call your doctor before switching to a generic version of your medication or taking other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. - Never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. - Notify your doctor immediately if you notice new or increased feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in your mood or behaviors. - Tell your doctor if you have migraines. Doctors may prescribe one of the anti-epileptic medications that can prevent your migraines and treat epilepsy. At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy will become seizure-free with their first medication. If anti-epileptic medications don&apost provide satisfactory results, your doctor may suggest surgery or other therapies. You&aposll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to evaluate your condition and medications. Surgery When medications fail to provide adequate control over seizures, surgery may be an option. With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that&aposs causing seizures. Doctors usually perform surgery when tests show that: - Your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain - The area in your brain to be operated on doesn&apost interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing Although many people continue to need some medication to help prevent seizures after successful surgery, you may be able to take fewer drugs and reduce your dosages. In a small number of cases, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications such as permanently altering your thinking (cognitive) abilities. Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure you&aposre considering. Therapies Apart from medications and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy: - Vagus nerve stimulation. In vagus nerve stimulation, doctors implant a device called a vagus nerve stimulator underneath the skin of your chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in your neck. The battery-powered device sends bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to your brain. It&aposs not clear how this inhibits seizures, but the device can usually reduce seizures by 20 to 40 percent. Most people still need to take anti-epileptic medication, although some people may be able to lower their medication dose. You may experience side effects from vagus nerve stimulation, such as throat pain, hoarse voice, shortness of breath or coughing. - Ketogenic diet. Some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a strict diet that&aposs high in fats and low in carbohydrates. In this diet, called a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. After a few years, some children may be able to stop the ketogenic diet - under close supervision of their doctors - and remain seizure-free. Consult a doctor if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet. It&aposs important to make sure that your child doesn&apost become malnourished when following the diet. Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include dehydration, constipation, slowed growth because of nutritional deficiencies and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can cause kidney stones. These side effects are uncommon if the diet is properly and medically supervised. Following a ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Low-glycemic index and modified Atkins diets offer less restrictive alternatives that may still provide some benefit for seizure control. Potential future treatments Researchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including: - Deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain, typically your thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest or the skull that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your seizures. - Responsive neurostimulation. Implantable, pacemaker-like devices that help prevent seizures are also under investigation. These responsive stimulation or closed loop devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures before they happen and deliver an electrical charge or drug to stop the seizure. - Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone (subthreshold stimulation). Subthreshold stimulation - continuous stimulation to an area of your brain below a level that&aposs physically noticeable - appears to improve seizure outcomes and quality of life for some people with seizures. This treatment approach may work in people who have seizures that start in an area of the brain that can&apost be removed because it would affect speech and motor functions (eloquent area). Or it might benefit people whose seizure characteristics mean their chances of successful treatment with responsive neurostimulation are low. - Minimally invasive surgery. New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI-guided laser ablation, show promise at reducing seizures with fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy. - Stereotactic laser ablation or radiosurgery. For some types of epilepsy, stereotactic laser ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery may provide effective treatment for people in which an open procedure may be too risky. In these procedures, doctors direct radiation at the specific area in the brain causing seizures, to destroy that tissue in an effort to better control the seizures. - External nerve stimulation device. Similar to vagus nerve stimulation, this device would stimulate specific nerves to reduce frequency of seizures. But unlike vagus nerve stimulation, this device would be worn externally so that no surgery to implant the device is needed. Understanding your condition can help you take better control of it: - Take your medication correctly. Don&apost adjust your dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly. - Exercise. Exercising may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water, and rest if you get tired during exercise. In addition, make healthy life choices, such as managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes.
0.444444444444	how is epilepsy diagnosed	Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (Diagnosis): The diagnosis of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is made on clinical grounds. The key to diagnosis is a detailed history from the affected person, as well as witnesses. Sometimes video- EEG monitoring is necessary. The features that are suggestive of a diagnosis of ADNFLE are: clusters of seizures with a frontal semiology seizures that occur predominantly during sleep normal clinical neurologic exam normal intellect (although reduced intellect, cognitive deficits, or psychiatric disorders may occur) normal findings on neuroimaging ictal EEG (recorded during a seizure) that may be normal or obscured by movement of the cables or electrodes interictal EEG (recorded in between seizures) that shows infrequent epileptiform discharges (distinctive patterns resembling those that occur in people with epilepsy) the presence of the same disorder in other family members, with evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance The diagnosis can be established in a person with the above features, combined with a positive family history and/or genetic testing that detects a mutation in one of the genes known to cause ADNFLE. People who are concerned they may be having seizures or other neurological signs or symptoms should be evaluated by a neurologist .
-0.888888888889	how is epilepsy diagnosed	Epilepsy (Treatment): Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects.
1.88888888889	how much ibuprofen is too much	Ibuprofen: People who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as ibuprofen may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Do not take an NSAID such as ibuprofen if you have recently had a heart attack, unless directed to do so by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke; if you smoke; and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech. If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not take ibuprofen right before or right after the surgery. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. These problems may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, or who drink three or more alcoholic drinks per day while taking ibuprofen. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants (&aposblood thinners&apos) such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Selfemra, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers, bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking ibuprofen and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body&aposs response to ibuprofen. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer&aposs patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with prescription ibuprofen and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer&aposs website to obtain the Medication Guide. Prescription ibuprofen is used to relieve pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints). It is also used to relieve mild to moderate pain, including menstrual pain (pain that happens before or during a menstrual period). Nonprescription ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain from headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual periods, the common cold, toothaches, and backaches. Ibuprofen is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body&aposs production of a substance that causes pain, fever, and inflammation. Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child&aposs age on the chart. Ask the child&aposs doctor if you don&apost know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops. The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water. Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child&aposs doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child&aposs doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child&aposs pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days. Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child&aposs doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition. Ibuprofen is also sometimes used to treat ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis that mainly affects the spine), gouty arthritis (joint pain caused by a build-up of certain substances in the joints), and psoriatic arthritis (arthritis that occurs with a long-lasting skin disease that causes scaling and swelling). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this drug for your condition. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking ibuprofen, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ibuprofen, aspirin or other NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in the type of ibuprofen you plan to take. Ask your pharmacist or check the label on the package for a list of the inactive ingredients. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention the medications listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section and any of the following: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin, in Lotrel), captopril, enalapril (Vasotec, in Vaseretic), fosinopril, lisinopril (in Zestoretic), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril (Aceon, in Prestalia), quinapril (Accupril, in Quinaretic), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik, in Tarka); angiotensin receptor blockers such as candesartan (Atacand, in Atacand HCT), eprosartan (Teveten), irbesartan (Avapro, in Avalide), losartan (Cozaar, in Hyzaar), olmesartan (Benicar, in Azor, in Benicar HCT, in Tribenzor), telmisartan (Micardis, in Micardis HCT, in Twynsta), and valsartan (in Exforge HCT); beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin, in Tenoretic), labetalol (Trandate), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL, in Dutoprol), nadolol (Corgard, in Corzide), and propranolol (Hemangeol, Inderal, Innopran); diuretics (&aposwater pills&apos); lithium (Lithobid); and methotrexate (Otrexup, Rasuvo, Trexall). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you more carefully for side effects. - do not take nonprescription ibuprofen with any other medication for pain unless your doctor tells you that you should. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any of the conditions mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section or asthma, especially if you also have frequent stuffed or runny nose or nasal polyps (swelling of the inside of the nose); heart failure; swelling of the hands, arms, feet, ankles, or lower legs; lupus (a condition in which the body attacks many of its own tissues and organs, often including the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys); or liver or kidney disease. If you are giving ibuprofen to a child, tell the child&aposs doctor if the child has not been drinking fluids or has lost a large amount of fluid from repeated vomiting or diarrhea. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your pregnancy; you plan to become pregnant; or you are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ibuprofen, call your doctor. - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ibuprofen. - if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inborn disease in which mental retardation develops if a specific diet is not followed), read the package label carefully before taking nonprescription ibuprofen. Some types of nonprescription ibuprofen may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Ibuprofen may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - constipation - diarrhea - gas or bloating - dizziness - nervousness - ringing in the ears Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, or those mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately. Do not take any more ibuprofen until you speak to your doctor. - unexplained weight gain - shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - swelling of the abdomen, feet, ankles, or lower legs - fever - blisters - rash - itching - hives - swelling of the eyes, face, throat, arms, or hands - difficulty breathing or swallowing - hoarseness - excessive tiredness - pain in the upper right part of the stomach - nausea - loss of appetite - yellowing of the skin or eyes - flu-like symptoms - pale skin - fast heartbeat - cloudy, discolored, or bloody urine - back pain - difficult or painful urination - blurred vision, changes in color vision, or other vision problems - red or painful eyes - stiff neck - headache - confusion - aggression Ibuprofen may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration&aposs (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA&aposs Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdosage may include: - dizziness - fast eye movements that you cannot control - slow breathing or short periods of time without breathing - blue color around the lips, mouth, and nose If you are taking prescription ibuprofen, do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital.

Give the dose that matches the child&aposs age on the chart. Ask the child&aposs doctor if you don&apost know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops.

2.0	how nicotine effects the brain	Nicotine dependence: Nicotine dependence -- also called tobacco dependence -- is an addiction to tobacco products caused by the drug nicotine. Nicotine dependence means you can&apost stop using the substance, even though it&aposs causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it&aposs the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you&aposve smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can&apost stop smoking. You&aposve made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you&aposve developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven&apost been able to stop. - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can&apost smoke in these locations or situations. You&aposre not alone if you&aposve tried to stop smoking but haven&apost been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You&aposre more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the "reward center" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work - After a meal - Drinking alcohol - Certain places or friends - Talking on the phone - Stressful situations or when you&aposre feeling down - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain&aposs nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes. - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke. - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you&aposll become a heavy smoker as an adult. - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers. - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even "all natural" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body&aposs immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse. - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths. - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year. - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems. - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration. - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men. - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns. - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn&apost as appetizing. - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis). - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails. - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don&apost live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you&aposve probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it&aposs rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You&aposre much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you&aposre pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you&aposre under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you&aposve set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven&apost been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You&aposll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It&aposs usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don&apost contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn&apost take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain&aposs nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven&apost helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It&aposs not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn&apost much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren&apost recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they&aposre banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It&aposs important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here&aposs what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don&apost want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, "I&aposll just smoke one to get through this tough time" or "Just one won&apost hurt," recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you&aposre feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be "natural." Just remember that "natural" doesn&apost necessarily mean "safe." Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there&aposs no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John&aposs wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety.

-0.857142857143	how nicotine effects the brain	Nicotine Lozenges: Nicotine lozenges are used to help people stop smoking. Nicotine lozenges are in a class of medications called smoking cessation aids. They work by providing nicotine to your body to decrease the withdrawal symptoms experienced when smoking is stopped and to reduce the urge to smoke. Nicotine comes as a lozenge to slowly dissolve in the mouth. It is usually used according to the directions on the package, at least 15 minutes after eating or drinking. Follow the directions on your medicine package carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine lozenges exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up in the morning, you should use 4-mg nicotine lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up in the morning, you should use 2 mg-nicotine lozenges. For Weeks 1 to 6 of treatment, you should use one lozenge every 1 to 2 hours. Using at least nine lozenges per day will increase your chance of quitting. For Weeks 7 to 9, you should use one lozenge every 2 to 4 hours. For Weeks 10 to 12, you should use one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Do not use more than five lozenges in 6 hours or more than 20 lozenges per day. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time or use one lozenge right after another. Using too many lozenges at a time or one after another can cause side effects such as hiccups, heartburn, and nausea. To use the lozenge, place it in your mouth and allow it to slowly dissolve. Do not chew or swallow lozenges. Once in a while, use your tongue to move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other. It should take 20 to 30 minutes to dissolve. Do not eat while the lozenge is in your mouth. Stop using nicotine lozenges after 12 weeks. If you still feel the need to use nicotine lozenges, talk to your doctor. This medication may be used for other conditions; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before using nicotine lozenges, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to nicotine or any other medications. - do not use nicotine lozenges if you are using any other nicotine smoking cessation aid, such as the nicotine patch, gum, inhaler, or nasal spray. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: non-nicotine smoking cessation aids, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin) or varenicline (Chantix), and medications for depression or asthma. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications once you stop smoking. - tell your doctor if you have recently had a heart attack and if you have or have ever had heart disease, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, a stomach ulcer, diabetes, or phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent mental retardation). - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using nicotine lozenges, call your doctor. - stop smoking completely. If you continue smoking while using nicotine lozenges, you may have side effects. - ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice and for written information to help you stop smoking. You are more likely to stop smoking during your treatment with nicotine lozenges if you get information and support from your doctor. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. Nicotine lozenges may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if either of these symptoms is severe or does not go away: - heartburn - sore throat Some side effects can be serious. If you experience either of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - mouth problems - irregular or fast heartbeat Nicotine lozenges may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication. Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children and pets. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If you need to remove a lozenge, wrap it in paper and dispose of it in a trash can safely, out of the reach of children and pets. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA&aposs Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdose may include: - nausea - vomiting - dizziness - diarrhea - weakness - fast heartbeat Keep all appointments with your doctor. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about nicotine lozenges. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies. - Commit® lozenges - Nicorette® lozenges
-0.714285714286	how nicotine effects the brain	Nicotine replacement therapy: Nicotine replacement therapy is a treatment to help people stop smoking. It uses products that supply low doses of nicotine. These products do not contain many of the toxins found in smoke. The goal of therapy is to cut down on cravings for nicotine and ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Before you start using a nicotine replacement product, here are some things to know: - The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher the dose you may need to start. - Adding a counseling program will make you more likely to quit. - DO NOT smoke while using nicotine replacement. It can cause nicotine to build up to toxic levels. - Nicotine replacement helps prevent weight gain while you are using it. You may still gain weight when you stop all nicotine use. - The dose of nicotine should be slowly decreased. TYPES OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY Nicotine supplements come in many forms: - Gum - Inhalers - Lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patch All of these work well if they are used correctly. People are more likely to use the gum and patches correctly than other forms. Nicotine patch You can buy nicotine patches without a prescription. Or, you can have your health care provider prescribe the patch for you. All nicotine patches are placed and used in similar ways: - A single patch is worn each day. It is replaced after 24 hours. - Place the patch on different areas above the waist and below the neck each day. - Put the patch on a hairless spot. - People who wear the patches for 24 hours will have fewer withdrawal symptoms. - If wearing the patch at night causes odd dreams, try sleeping without the patch. - People who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day should start with a lower dose patch (for example, 14 mg). Nicotine gum or lozenge You can buy nicotine gum or lozenges without a prescription. Some people prefer lozenges to the patch, because they can control the nicotine dose. Tips for using the gum: - Follow the instructions that comes with the package. - If you are just starting to quit, chew 1 to 2 pieces each hour. DO NOT chew more than 20 pieces a day. - Chew the gum slowly until it develops a peppery taste. Then, keep it between the gum and cheek and store it there. This lets the nicotine be absorbed. - Wait at least 15 minutes after drinking coffee, tea, soft drinks, and acidic beverages before chewing a piece of gum. - People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day have better results with the 4 mg dose than with the 2 mg dose. - The goal is to stop using the gum by 12 weeks. Talk with your doctor before using the gum for a longer period. Nicotine inhaler The nicotine inhaler looks like a plastic cigarette holder. It requires a prescription in the United States. - Insert nicotine cartridges into the inhaler and "puff" for about 20 minutes. Do this up to 16 times a day. - The inhaler is quick-acting. It takes about the same time as the gum to act. It is faster than the 2 to 4 hours it takes for the patch to work. - The inhaler satisfies oral urges. - Most of the nicotine vapor does not go into the airways of the lung. Some people have mouth or throat irritation and cough with the inhaler. It can help to use the inhaler and patch together when quitting. Nicotine nasal spray The nasal spray needs to be prescribed by a health care provider. The spray gives a quick dose of nicotine to satisfy a craving you are unable to ignore. Levels of nicotine peak within 5 to 10 minutes after using the spray. - Follow your health care provider&aposs instructions about how to use the spray. When you&aposre starting to quit, you may be told to spray 1 to 2 times in each nostril, every hour. You should not spray more than 80 times in 1 day. - The spray should not be used for longer than 6 months. - The spray can irritate the nose, eyes, and throat. These side effects often go away in a few days. SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS All nicotine products may cause side effects. Symptoms are more likely when you use very high doses. Reducing the dose can prevent these symptoms. Side effects include: - Headaches - Nausea and other digestive problems - Problems getting to sleep in the first few days, most often with the patch. This problem usually passes. SPECIAL CONCERNS Nicotine patches are OK for use by most people with stable heart or blood circulation problems. But, the unhealthy cholesterol levels (lower HDL level) caused by smoking do not get better until the nicotine patch is stopped. Nicotine replacement may not be completely safe in pregnant women. The unborn children of women who use the patch may have a faster heart rate. Keep all nicotine products away from children. Nicotine is a poison. - The concern is greater for small children. - Call the doctor or a poison control center right away if a child has been exposed to a nicotine replacement product, even for a short time.

1.85714285714	how nicotine effects the brain	Nicotine and tobacco: The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can: - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression - Increase activity in the intestines - Create more saliva and phlegm - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include: - Intense craving for nicotine - Anxiety - Depression - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping - Bad dreams and nightmares - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated - Headaches - Increased appetite and weight gain - Problems concentrating You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking. There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone. To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences. Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking. A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

-0.571428571429	how nicotine effects the brain	Nicotine Transdermal Patch: Nicotine skin patches are used to help people stop smoking cigarettes. They provide a source of nicotine that reduces the withdrawal symptoms experienced when smoking is stopped. Nicotine patches are applied directly to the skin. They are applied once a day, usually at the same time each day. Nicotine patches come in various strengths and may be used for various lengths of time. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine skin patches exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor. Apply the patch to a clean, dry, hairless area of skin on the upper chest, upper arm, or hip as directed by the package directions. Avoid areas of irritated, oily, scarred, or broken skin. Remove the patch from the package, peel off the protective strip, and immediately apply the patch to your skin. With the sticky side touching the skin, press the patch in place with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds. Be sure the patch is held firmly in place, especially around the edges. Wash your hands with water alone after applying the patch. If the patch falls off or loosens, replace it with a new one. You should wear the patch continuously for 16 to 24 hours, depending on the specific directions inside your nicotine patch package. The patch may be worn even while showering or bathing. Remove the patch carefully and fold the patch in half with the sticky side pressed together. Dispose of it safely, out of the reach of children and pets. After removing the used patch, apply the next patch to a different skin area to prevent skin irritation. Never wear two patches at once. A switch to a lower strength patch may be considered after the first 2 weeks on the medication. A gradual reduction to lower strength patches is recommended to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine patches may be used from 6 to 20 weeks depending on the specific instructions supplied with the patches. Before using nicotine skin patches, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to adhesive tape or any drugs. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially acetaminophen (Tylenol), caffeine, diuretics (&aposwater pills&apos), imipramine (Tofranil), insulin, medications for high blood pressure, oxazepam (Serax), pentazocine (Talwin, Talwin NX, Talacen), propoxyphene (Darvon, E-Lor), propranolol (Inderal), theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamins. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a heart attack, irregular heart rate, angina (chest pain), ulcers, uncontrolled high blood pressure, overactive thyroid, pheochromocytoma, or a skin condition or disorder. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using nicotine skin patches, call your doctor immediately. Nicotine and nicotine skin patches may cause harm to the fetus. - do not smoke cigarettes or use other nicotine products while using nicotine skin patches because nicotine overdose can result. Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one. Nicotine skin patches may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - dizziness - headache - nausea - vomiting - diarrhea - redness or swelling at the patch site If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - severe rash or swelling - seizures - abnormal heartbeat or rhythm - difficulty breathing If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration&aposs (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA&aposs Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Keep all appointments with your doctor. Do not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies. - Nicoderm® CQ Patch - Nicotrol® Patch
1.88888888889	how often do you need a pap smear	Pap test: The Pap test checks for cervical cancer. Cells scraped from the opening of the cervix are examined under a microscope. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. This test is sometimes called a Pap smear. You lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups. The health care provider gently places an instrument called a speculum into the vagina to open it slightly. This allows the provider to see inside the vagina and cervix. Cells are gently scraped from the cervix area. The sample of cells is sent to a lab for examination. Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking. Some birth control pills that contain estrogen or progestin may affect test results. Also tell your provider if you: - Have had an abnormal Pap test - Might be pregnant DO NOT do the following for 24 hours before the test: - Douche (douching should never be done) - Have intercourse - Use tampons Avoid scheduling your Pap test while you have your period (are menstruating). Blood may make the Pap test results less accurate. If you are having unexpected bleeding, do not cancel your exam. Your provider will determine if the Pap test can still be done. Empty your bladder just before the test. A Pap test causes little to no discomfort for most women. It can cause some discomfort, similar to menstrual cramps. You may also feel some pressure during the exam. You may bleed a little bit after the test. The Pap test is a screening test for cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers can be detected early if a woman has routine Pap tests. Screening should start at age 21. After the first test: - You should have a Pap test every 3 years to check for cervical cancer. - If you are over age 30 and you also have HPV testing done, and both the Pap test and HPV test are normal, you can be tested every 5 years (HPV is the human papillomavirus, the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer). - Most women can stop having Pap tests after age 65 to 70 as long as they have had 3 negative tests within the past 10 years. You may not need to have a Pap test if you have had a total hysterectomy (uterus and cervix removed) and have not had an abnormal Pap test, cervical cancer, or other pelvic cancer. Discuss this with your provider. A normal result means there are no abnormal cells present. The Pap test is not 100% accurate. Cervical cancer may be missed in a small number of cases. Most of the time, cervical cancer develops very slowly, and follow-up Pap tests should find any changes in time for treatment. Abnormal results are grouped as follows: ASCUS or AGUS: - This result means there are atypical cells, but it is uncertain or unclear what these changes mean - The changes may be due to HPV - They may also mean there are changes that may lead to cancer LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LSIL) OR HIGH-GRADE DYSPLASIA (HSIL): - This means changes that may lead to cancer are present - The risk of cervical cancer is greater with HSIL CARCINOMA IN SITU (CIS): - This result most often means the abnormal changes are likely to lead to cervical cancer if not treated ATYPICAL SQUAMOUS CELLS (ASC): - Abnormal changes have been found and may be HSIL ATYPICAL GLANDULAR CELLS (AGC): - Cell changes that may lead to cancer are seen in the upper part of the cervical canal or inside the uterus When a Pap test shows abnormal changes, further testing or follow-up is needed. The next step depends on the results of the Pap test, your previous history of Pap tests, and risk factors you may have for cervical cancer. For minor cell changes, doctors will recommend another Pap test in 6 to 12 months. Follow-up testing or treatment may include: - Colposcopy-directed biopsy - An HPV test to check for the presence of the HPV virus types most likely to cause cancer - Cervix cryosurgery - Cone biopsy Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

-1.88888888889	how often do you need a pap smear	Do you have information about CSF smear: Summary : A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) smear is an exam of the fluid that moves in the space around the spinal cord and brain. CSF protects the brain and spinal cord from injury. How the Test is Performed : A sample of CSF fluid is needed. This is usually done with a lumbar puncture. This is called a spinal tap. The sample is sent to a laboratory, where a tiny amount is spread on a glass slide. A member of the laboratory team looks at the sample under a microscope. The smear shows the color of the fluid and the number and shape of cells present in the fluid. Other tests, such as a Gram stain or fungal wet prep, may be done to check for bacteria or fungi. How to Prepare for the Test : For information on how to prepare for the procedure to obtain the CSF sample, see spinal tap. How the Test Will Feel : The laboratory test is painless and does not involve you. For information on how it will feel to have a sample of CSF fluid removed, see spinal tap. Why the Test is Performed : The test is done to check for signs of infection in a sample of CSF. What Abnormal Results Mean : Bacteria or other germs in the sample may be a sign of: - Bacterial meningitis - Fungal infections - Tuberculosis Some bacteria or viruses can also be detected using special tests. Risks : A laboratory smear poses no risk. For risks from the procedure done to get a CSF sample, see spinal tap.
-0.555555555556	how often do you need a pap smear	HPV DNA test: The HPV DNA test is used to check for high-risk HPV infection in women. HPV infection around the genitals is common. It can be spread during sex. - Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer and other cancers. These are called high-risk types. - Low-risk types of HPV may cause genital warts in the vagina, cervix, and on the skin. The virus that causes warts can be spread when you have sex. The HPV-DNA test is generally not recommended for detecting low-risk HPV infections. The HPV DNA test may be done during a Pap smear. You lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups. The health care provider places an instrument (called a speculum) into the vagina and opens it slightly to see inside. Cells are gently collected from the cervix area. The cervix is the lower part of the womb (uterus) that opens at the top of the vagina. The cells are sent to a laboratory for examination under a microscope. This examiner checks to see if the cells contain genetic material (called DNA) from types of HPV that cause cancer. More tests may be done to determine the exact type of HPV. Avoid the following for 24 hours before the test: - Douching - Having intercourse - Taking a bath - Using tampons Empty your bladder just before the test. The exam may cause some discomfort. Some women say it feels like menstrual cramps. You may also feel some pressure during the exam. You may bleed a bit after the test. High-risk types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer or anal cancer. The HPV-DNA test is done to determine if you are infected with one of these high-risk types. Your doctor may order an HPV-DNA test: - If you have a certain type of abnormal Pap test result - Along with a Pap smear to screen women age 30 and older for cervical cancer It&aposs important to note that the HPV-DNA test does not replace a Pap smear. A Pap smear is the main screening test for cervical cancer. The HPV test results help your doctor decide if further testing or treatment is needed. A normal result means you do not have a high-risk type of HPV. An abnormal result means you have a high-risk type of HPV. High-risk types of HPV may cause cervical cancer and cancer of the throat, tongue, anus, or vagina. Most of the time, cervical cancer related to HPV is due to the following types: - HPV-16 (high risk type) - HPV-18 (high risk type) - HPV-31 - HPV-33 - HPV-35 - HPV-45 - HPV-52 - HPV-58 Other high-risk types of HPV are less common.

-0.666666666667	how often do you need a pap smear	Cervical dysplasia (Exams and Tests): You will have a pelvic exam. Cervical dysplasia that is seen on a Pap smear is called squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the Pap smear report, these changes will be described as: - Low-grade (LSIL) - High-grade (HSIL) - Possibly cancerous (malignant) - Atypical glandular cells (AGUS) - Atypical squamous cells You will need more tests if a Pap smear shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia. If the changes were mild, follow-up Pap smears may be all that is needed. A biopsy to confirm the condition is often needed, however. This may be done using colposcopy-directed biopsy. A colposcopy is a procedure performed in your health care provider&aposs office. Any areas of concern will be biopsied. The biopsies are very small and most women feel only a small cramp. Dysplasia that is seen on a biopsy of the cervix is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It is grouped into 3 categories: - CIN I -- mild dysplasia - CIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia - CIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ Some strains of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer. An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done: - As a screening test for women over age 30 - For women of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result
0.777777777778	how often do you need a pap smear	Cervical dysplasia: Cervical dysplasia refers to abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. The changes are not cancer. But they are considered to be precancerous. This means they can lead to cancer of the cervix if not treated. Cervical dysplasia can develop at any age. However, follow up and treatment will depend on your age. Most often, cervical dysplasia is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many types of HPV. Some types lead to cervical dysplasia or cancer. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts. The following may increase your risk for cervical dysplasia: - Having sex before age 18 - Having a baby before age 16 - Having had multiple sexual partners - Having other illnesses, such as diabetes or HIV - Using medicines that suppress your immune system - Smoking Most of the time, there are no symptoms. You will have a pelvic exam. Cervical dysplasia that is seen on a Pap smear is called squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the Pap smear report, these changes will be described as: - Low-grade (LSIL) - High-grade (HSIL) - Possibly cancerous (malignant) - Atypical glandular cells (AGUS) - Atypical squamous cells You will need more tests if a Pap smear shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia.

An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done: - As a screening test for women over age 30 - For women of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result Treatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment. - You may only need careful follow-up by your provider with repeat Pap smears every 6 to 12 months. - If the changes do not go away or get worse, treatment is needed. Treatment for moderate-to-severe dysplasia or mild dysplasia that does not go away may include: - Cryosurgery to freeze abnormal cells - Laser therapy, which uses light to burn away abnormal tissue - LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Surgery to remove the abnormal tissue (cone biopsy) - Hysterectomy (in rare cases) If you have had dysplasia, you will need to have repeat exams every 12 months or as recommended by your provider. Make sure to get the HPV vaccine when it is offered to you. This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. However, the condition may return. Without treatment, severe cervical dysplasia may change into cervical cancer. Call your provider if your age is 21 or older and you have never had a pelvic exam and Pap smear. Ask your provider about the HPV vaccine. Girls who receive this vaccine before they become sexually active reduce their chance of getting cervical cancer. You can reduce your risk of developing cervical dysplasia by taking the following steps: - Do not smoke. Smoking increases your risk of developing more severe dysplasia and cancer. - Get vaccinated for HPV between ages 9 to 26. - Do not have sex until you are 18 or older. - Practice safe sex, and use a condom. - Practice monogamy. This means you have only one sexual partner at a time. Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

2.0	how often do you need a pap smear	Cervical cancer - screening and prevention (Pap Smears): Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as precancerous changes called dysplasia. Dysplasia can be detected by a medical test called a Pap smear. Dysplasia is fully treatable. That is why it is important for women to get regular Pap smears, so that precancerous cells can be removed before they can become cancer. Pap smear screening should start at age 21. After the first test: - Women ages 21 through 29 should have a Pap smear every 3 years. - Women ages 30 through 65 should be screened with either a Pap smear every 3 years or a Pap smear and HPV test every 5 years. - If you or your sexual partner has other new partners, you should have a Pap smear every 3 years. - Women ages 65 through 70 can stop having Pap smears as long as they have had 3 normal tests within the past 10 years. - Women who have been treated for precancer (cervical dysplasia) should continue to have Pap smears for 20 years after treatment or until age 65, whichever is longer. Talk with your provider about how often you should have a Pap smear.
-0.857142857143	how smoking tobacco affects the brain	Nicotine and tobacco (Treatment): It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking. There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone. To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences. Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking. A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription.

-0.714285714286	how smoking tobacco affects the brain	What is Smoking?: There&aposs no way around it. Smoking is bad for your health. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. It is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. These include lung disease, heart and blood vessel disease, stroke and cataracts. Women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do. E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Not much is known about the health risks of using them. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. NIH: National Cancer Institute
0.857142857143	how smoking tobacco affects the brain	Smoking cessation medications: Your health care provider can prescribe medicines to help you quit tobacco use. These medicines do not contain nicotine and are not habit-forming. They work in a different way than nicotine patches, gums, sprays, or lozenges. Smoking cessation medicines can: - Help with the craving for tobacco. - Help you with withdrawal symptoms. - Keep you from starting to use tobacco again. Like other treatments, these medicines work best when they are part of a program that includes: - Making a clear decision to quit and setting a quit date. - Creating a plan to help you deal with smoking urges. - Getting support from a doctor, counselor, or support group. BUPROPION (Zyban) Bupropion is a pill that may cut down your craving for tobacco. Bupropion is also used for people with depression. It helps with quitting tobacco even if you do not have problems with depression. It is not fully clear how bupropion helps with tobacco cravings. Bupropion should not be used for people who: - Are under age 18. - Are pregnant. - Have a history of medical problems such seizures, kidney failure, heavy alcohol use, eating disorders, bipolar or manic depressive illness, or a serious head injury. How to take it: - Start bupropion 1 week before you plan to stop smoking. Your goal is to take it for 7 to 12 weeks.  Talk with your doctor before taking it for a longer period of time.  - The most common dose is a 150 mg tablet once or twice a day with 8 hours between each dose. Swallow the pill whole. DO NOT chew, split, or crush it. Doing so can cause side effects, including seizures. - If you need help with cravings when first quitting, you may take bupropion along with nicotine patches, gums, or lozenges. Ask your doctor if this is OK for you. Side effects of this medicine may include: - Dry mouth. - Problems sleeping. Try taking the second dose in the afternoon if you have this problem (take it at least 8 hours after the first dose). - Stop taking this medicine right away if you have changes in behavior. These include anger, agitation, depressed mood, thoughts of suicide, or attempted suicide. VARENICLINE (CHANTIX) Varenicline (Chantix) helps with the craving for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms. It works in the brain to reduce the physical effects of nicotine. This means that even if you start smoking again after quitting, you will not get as much pleasure from it when you are taking this drug. How to take it: - Start taking this medicine 1 week before you plan to quit cigarettes. You will take it for 12 to 24 weeks. - Take it after meals with a full glass of water. - Your provider will tell you how to take this medicine. Most people take one 0.5 mg pill a day at first. By the end of the second week, you will likely be taking a 1 mg pill twice a day. - DO NOT combine this drug with nicotine patches, gums, sprays or lozenges. - Children under age 18 should not take this drug. Most people tolerate varenicline well. Side effects are not common, but can include the following if they do occur: - Headaches, problems sleeping, sleepiness, and strange dreams. - Constipation, intestinal gas, nausea, and changes in taste. - Depressed mood, thoughts of suicide and attempted suicide. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. NOTE: Use of this medicine is linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. OTHER MEDICINES The following medicines may help when other treatments have not worked. The benefits are less consistent, so they are considered second-line treatment. - Clonidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure. It may help when it is started before quitting. This drug comes as a pill or patch. - Nortriptyline is another antidepressant. It is started 10 to 28 days before quitting. Updated by: Laura J.

0.714285714286	how smoking tobacco affects the brain	Smoking and surgery: Quitting smoking and other tobacco products before surgery can improve your recovery and outcome after surgery. Most people who successfully quit smoking have tried and failed many times. DO NOT give up. Learning from your past tries can help you succeed. Tar, nicotine, and other chemicals from smoking can increase your risk of many health problems. These include heart and blood vessel problems, such as: - Blood clots and aneurysms in the brain, which can lead to strokes - Coronary artery disease, including chest pain (angina) and heart attacks - High blood pressure - Poor blood supply to the legs - Problems with erections Smoking also increases your risk for different types of cancer, including cancer of the: - Lungs - Mouth - Larynx - Esophagus - Bladder - Kidneys - Pancreas - Cervix Smoking also leads to lung problems, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and makes asthma harder to control. Some smokers switch to smokeless tobacco instead of quitting tobacco completely. But using smokeless tobacco still carries health risks, such as: - Developing mouth or nasal cancer - Gum problems, tooth wear, and cavities - Worsening high blood pressure and chest pain Smokers who have surgery have a higher chance than nonsmokers of blood clots forming in their legs. These clots may travel to and damage the lungs. Smoking decreases the amount of oxygen that reaches the cells in your surgical wound. As a result, your wound may heal more slowly and is more likely to become infected. All smokers carry an increased risk for heart and lung problems. Even when your surgery goes smoothly, smoking causes your body, heart, and lungs to work harder than if you did not smoke. Most doctors will tell you to stop using cigarettes and tobacco at least 4 weeks before your surgery. Stretching the time between quitting smoking and your surgery out to at least 10 weeks can decrease your risk of problems even more. Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult. There are many ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you, such as: - Family members, friends, and coworkers may be supportive or encouraging. - Talk to your doctor about medicines, such as nicotine replacement and prescription medicines. - If you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites. Using nicotine gum around the time of surgery is not encouraged. The nicotine will still interfere with the healing of your surgical wound and have the same effect on your general health as using cigarettes and tobacco. Updated by: Debra G.

1.0	how smoking tobacco affects the brain	Nicotine and tobacco: The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.

Common symptoms include: - Intense craving for nicotine - Anxiety - Depression - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping - Bad dreams and nightmares - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated - Headaches - Increased appetite and weight gain - Problems concentrating You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke.

These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.
0.714285714286	how smoking tobacco affects the rest of the body	What is Smoking?: There&aposs no way around it. Smoking is bad for your health. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. It is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. These include lung disease, heart and blood vessel disease, stroke and cataracts. Women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

0.571428571429	how smoking tobacco affects the rest of the body	Smoking and surgery: Quitting smoking and other tobacco products before surgery can improve your recovery and outcome after surgery. Most people who successfully quit smoking have tried and failed many times. DO NOT give up. Learning from your past tries can help you succeed. Tar, nicotine, and other chemicals from smoking can increase your risk of many health problems. These include heart and blood vessel problems, such as: - Blood clots and aneurysms in the brain, which can lead to strokes - Coronary artery disease, including chest pain (angina) and heart attacks - High blood pressure - Poor blood supply to the legs - Problems with erections Smoking also increases your risk for different types of cancer, including cancer of the: - Lungs - Mouth - Larynx - Esophagus - Bladder - Kidneys - Pancreas - Cervix Smoking also leads to lung problems, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and makes asthma harder to control. Some smokers switch to smokeless tobacco instead of quitting tobacco completely. But using smokeless tobacco still carries health risks, such as: - Developing mouth or nasal cancer - Gum problems, tooth wear, and cavities - Worsening high blood pressure and chest pain Smokers who have surgery have a higher chance than nonsmokers of blood clots forming in their legs. These clots may travel to and damage the lungs. Smoking decreases the amount of oxygen that reaches the cells in your surgical wound. As a result, your wound may heal more slowly and is more likely to become infected. All smokers carry an increased risk for heart and lung problems. Even when your surgery goes smoothly, smoking causes your body, heart, and lungs to work harder than if you did not smoke. Most doctors will tell you to stop using cigarettes and tobacco at least 4 weeks before your surgery. Stretching the time between quitting smoking and your surgery out to at least 10 weeks can decrease your risk of problems even more. Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult. There are many ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you, such as: - Family members, friends, and coworkers may be supportive or encouraging. - Talk to your doctor about medicines, such as nicotine replacement and prescription medicines. - If you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites. Using nicotine gum around the time of surgery is not encouraged. The nicotine will still interfere with the healing of your surgical wound and have the same effect on your general health as using cigarettes and tobacco. Updated by: Debra G.

-1.9	how to loose weight	Making the decision to breastfeed (Can breastfeeding help me lose weight?): Besides giving your baby nourishment and helping to keep your baby from becoming sick, breastfeeding may help you lose weight. Many women who breastfed their babies said it helped them get back to their pre-pregnancy weight more quickly, but experts are still looking at the effects of breastfeeding on weight loss.
1.9	how to loose weight	Exercise and activity for weight loss (The Weight-loss Formula): Calories used in exercise > calories eaten = weight loss. This means that to lose weight, the number of calories you burn by exercising needs to be greater than the number of calories from the foods you eat and drink. Even if you work out a lot, if you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. Another way to look at this is that a woman ages 30 to 50 years who does not exercise needs about 1,800 calories a day to maintain her normal weight. A man ages 30 to 50 years who does not exercise needs about 2,200 calories to maintain his normal weight. For every hour of exercise they do, they would burn: - 240 to 300 calories doing light activity such as cleaning house or playing baseball or golf. - 370 to 460 calories doing activity such as a brisk walk (3.5 mph), gardening, biking (5.5 mph), or dancing. - 580 to 730 calories doing activity such as jogging at a pace of 9 minutes per mile, playing football, or swimming laps. - 740 to 920 calories doing activity such as running at a pace of 7 minutes per mile, playing racquetball, and skiing. Even if you don&apost change the amount of calories in your diet, but you do add activity to your daily life, you&aposll lose weight or gain less weight.
0.7	how to loose weight	Very Low-calorie Diets (Should I use a VLCD to lose weight?): Most people who need to lose weight should not use a VLCD. For many of them, a low-calorie diet (LCD) may work better (see The Low-calorie Diet (LCD)).VLCDs may be used to promote rapid weight loss among adults who have obesity. Health care providers must review risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis.In general, VLCDs are not appropriate for children. In a few cases, they may be used with some adolescents who are being treated for obesity.Not much is known about the use of VLCDs to promote weight loss among older adults. Some people over age 50 may have medical issues that may not make them good candidates for this type of diet.
0.8	how to loose weight	Diet for rapid weight loss: Rapid weight loss diet is a type of diet in which you lose more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram, kg) a week over several weeks. To lose weight this quickly you eat very few calories. These diets are most often for obese people who need to lose weight quickly because of a health problem. People on these diets should be followed closely by a health care provider. Rapid weight loss is not safe for most people to do on their own. These diets are only to be used for a short time and are not recommended for more than several weeks. The types of rapid weight loss diets are described below. On a VLCD, you may have as few as 800 calories a day and may lose up to 3 to 5 pounds (1.5 to 2 kg) week. Most VLCDs use meal replacements, such as formulas, soups, shakes, and bars instead of regular meals. This helps ensure that you get all of the nutrients you need each day. A VLCD is only recommended for adults who are obese and need to lose weight for health reasons. These diets are often used before weight-loss surgery. You should only use a VLCD with the help of your health care provider. Most experts DO NOT recommend using a VLCD for more than 12 weeks. These diets usually allow about 1000 to 1200 calories a day for women and 1200 to 1600 calories a day for men. An LCD is a better choice than a VLCD for most people who want to lose weight quickly. But you should still be supervised by a provider. You will not lose weight as fast with an LCD, but you can lose just as much weight with a VLCD. An LCD may use a mix of meal replacements and regular food. This makes it easier to follow than a VLCD. Some fad diets also severely limit calories to achieve rapid weight loss. In many cases, these diets are not safe. Once you stop the diet, you are at risk for regaining the weight if you return to your old eating habits. For most people, it is safest to choose a diet in which you lose a 1/2 pound to 2 pounds (225 grams to 1 kg) a week. Rapid weight loss is more about cutting calories than exercising. Talk with your provider about what type of exercise you should do while you are on this type of diet. Your provider may suggest waiting until you are on a more long-term diet to start exercising. Rapid weight loss diet is usually for people who have health problems because of obesity. For these people, losing a lot of weight quickly can help improve: - Diabetes - High cholesterol - High blood pressure You should only follow one of these diets with the help of your provider. Losing more than one 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg) a week is not safe for most people. It can cause you to lose muscle, water, and bone density. Rapid weight loss can also cause some side effects including: - Gallstones - Gout - Fatigue - Constipation - Diarrhea - Nausea People who lose weight quickly are also more likely to gain back the weight quickly. This can lead to other health problems. In general, a rapid weight loss diet is not safe for children. It may also not be safe for teens, pregnant women or older adults unless a provider recommends it. If you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your provider before starting this or any diet plan to lose weight.

-0.7	how to loose weight	Weight gain after quitting smoking: What to do: Many people gain weight when they quit smoking cigarettes. On average, people gain 5 to 10 pounds (2.25 to 4.5 kilograms) in the months after they give up smoking. You may put off quitting if you are worried about adding extra weight. But NOT smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. Fortunately, there are things you can do to keep your weight under control when you quit. There are a couple of reasons why people gain weight when they give up cigarettes. Some have to do with the way nicotine affects your body. - The nicotine in cigarettes speeds up your metabolism. Nicotine increases the amount of calories your body uses at rest by about 7% to 15%. Without cigarettes, your body may burn food more slowly. - Cigarettes reduce appetite. When you quit smoking, you may feel hungrier. - Smoking is a habit. After you quit, you may crave high-calorie foods to replace cigarettes. As you get ready to quit smoking, here are some things you can do to keep your weight in check. - Get active.Physical activity helps you burn calories. It can also help you ward off cravings for unhealthy foods or cigarettes. If you already exercise, you may need to exercise for longer or more often to burn the calories nicotine used to help remove. - Shop for healthy groceries. Decide what you will buy before you get to the store. Make a list of healthy foods like fruit, vegetables, and low-fat yogurt that you can indulge in without eating too many calories. Stock up on low-calorie "finger foods" that can keep your hands busy, such as sliced apples, baby carrots, or pre-portioned unsalted nuts. - Stock up on sugar-free gum. It can keep your mouth busy without adding calories or exposing your teeth to sugar. - Create healthy eating habits. Make a healthy meal plan ahead of time so you can combat cravings when they hit. It is easier to say "no" to fried chicken nuggets if you are looking ahead to a roast chicken with vegetables for dinner. - Never let yourself get too hungry. A little hunger is a good thing, but if you are so hungry that you have to eat right away, you are more likely to reach for a diet-busting option. Learning to eat foods that fill you up can also help ward off hunger. - Sleep well. If you often do not get enough sleep, you are at greater risk of putting on extra weight. - Control your drinking. Alcohol, sugary sodas, and sweetened juices may go down easy, but they add up, and can lead to weight gain. Try sparkling water with 100% fruit juice or herbal tea instead. Giving up a habit takes time to get used to, both physically and emotionally. Take one step at a time. If you do put on some weight but manage to stay off cigarettes, congratulate yourself. There are many benefits of quitting. - Your lungs and heart will be stronger. - Your skin will look younger. - Your teeth will be whiter. - You will have better breath. - Your hair and clothes will smell better. - You will have more money when you are not buying cigarettes. - You will perform better in sports or other physical activities. If you have tried to quit smoking and relapsed, your health care provider may suggest nicotine replacement therapy. Treatments that come in the form of a patch, gum, nasal spray, or inhaler give you small doses of nicotine throughout the day. They can help ease the transition from smoking to going totally smoke-free. If you gain weight after quitting and cannot lose it, you might have better results in an organized program. Ask your provider to recommend a program with a good record that can help you lose weight in a healthy, lasting way. Updated by: Linda J.

0.4	how to loose weight	Losing weight after pregnancy: You should plan to return to your pre-pregnancy weight by 6 to 12 months after delivery. Most women lose half of their baby weight by 6 weeks after childbirth (postpartum). The rest most often comes off over the next several months. A healthy diet with daily exercise will help you shed the pounds. Breastfeeding can also help with postpartum weight loss. Your body needs time to recover from childbirth. If you lose weight too soon after childbirth, it can take longer for you to recover. Give yourself until your 6-week checkup before trying to slim down. If you are breastfeeding, wait until your baby is at least 2 months old and your milk supply has normalized before drastically cutting calories. - Aim for a weight loss of about a pound and a half a week. You can do this by eating healthy foods and adding in exercise once you are cleared by your health care provider for regular physical activity. - Women who are exclusively breastfeeding need about 500 more calories per day than they did before pregnancy. Get these calories from healthy choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein. - DO NOT drop below the minimum number of calories you need. If you are breastfeeding, you will want to lose weight slowly. Weight loss that happens too fast can make you produce less milk. Losing about a pound and a half (670 grams) a week should not affect your milk supply or your health. Breastfeeding makes your body burn calories which helps you lose weight. If you are patient, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally while breastfeeding. These healthy eating tips will help you lose weight safely. - DO NOT skip meals. With a new baby, many new moms forget to eat. If you do not eat, you will have less energy, and it will not help you lose weight. - Eat 5 to 6 small meals a day with healthy snacks in between (rather than 3 larger meals). - Eat breakfast. Even if you do not normally eat in the mornings, get into the habit of having breakfast. It will give you energy to start your day and stop you from feeling tired later. - Slow down. When you take your time eating, you will notice that it is easier to tell that you are full. It is tempting to multitask, but if you focus on your meal you will be less likely to overeat. - Choose nonfat or low-fat dairy products. - When you reach for a snack try to include foods with fiber and protein to help keep you full (such as raw bell pepper or carrot with bean dip, apple slices with peanut butter, or a slice of whole-wheat toast with hard-boiled egg). Drink at least 12 cups of fluid a day. - Keep a water bottle near the spot where you usually feed the baby, that way you&aposll remember to drink when they do. - Limit drinks like sodas, juices, and other fluids with added sugar and calories. They can add up and keep you from losing weight. - Choose broiled or baked rather than fried foods. - Limit sweets, sugar, saturated fat and trans fats. DO NOT go on a crash diet (not eating enough) or a fad diet (popular diets that limit certain types of foods and nutrients). They will probably make you drop pounds at first, but those first few pounds you lose are fluid and will come back. Other pounds you lose on a crash diet may be muscle instead of fat. You will gain back any fat you lose on a crash diet once you return to normal eating. You may not be able to return to your exact pre-pregnancy shape. For many women, pregnancy causes lasting changes in the body. You may have a softer belly, wider hips, and a larger waistline. Make your goals about your new body realistic. A healthy diet combined with regular exercise is the best way to shed the pounds. Exercise will help you lose fat instead of muscle. Once you are ready to start losing weight, eat a little less and move a little more each day. It may be tempting to push yourself into a hard routine for fast weight loss. But rapid weight loss is not healthy and is hard on your body. DO NOT overdo it. Just a quick walk around the block with your baby in the stroller is a great way to start adding exercise to your daily routine. Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

0.5	how to manage prostate cancer	Prostate cancer - treatment (Hormonal Therapy): Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body&aposs testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment.
-0.75	how to manage prostate cancer	What is prostate cancer?: Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or later. In this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. Men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen (PSA) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. As the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. However, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer. The severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. Early-stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. In other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening. Some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. The signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. If prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips. A small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. These hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary prostate cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases.
1.75	how to manage prostate cancer	Prostate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your doctor must think about include: - Your age and other medical problems you may have - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment - How much the prostate cancer has spread - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices: - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: - Appetite loss - Diarrhea - Erection problems - Fatigue - Rectal burning or injury - Skin reactions - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. - The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum - Red-brown urine or semen - Impotence - Incontinence - Urinary retention - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence.

Much of the body&aposs testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body&aposs immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

2.0	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis (PREVENTION): Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and its related diseases. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors you have. One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include: Heart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Physical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart. Quit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart. Weight Control. If you’re overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for atherosclerosis. Other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises.  
0.888888888889	how to prevent atherosclerosis	What is Atherosclerosis?: Espaol Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart and other parts of your body. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body. Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis-Related Diseases Atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, and kidneys. As a result, different diseases may develop based on which arteries are affected. Coronary Heart Disease Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease, occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. If blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, you may have angina (chest pain or discomfort) or a heart attack. Plaque also can form in the heart&aposs smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). In coronary MVD, plaque doesn&apost cause blockages in the arteries as it does in CHD. Carotid Artery Disease Carotid (ka-ROT-id) artery disease occurs if plaque builds up in the arteries on each side of your neck (the carotid arteries). These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. If blood flow to your brain is reduced or blocked, you may have a stroke. Peripheral Artery Disease Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) occurs if plaque builds up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your legs, arms, and pelvis. If blood flow to these parts of your body is reduced or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and, sometimes, dangerous infections. Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease can occur if plaque builds up in the renal arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your kidneys. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function. The main function of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra water from the body. Overview The cause of atherosclerosis isn&apost known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. You can control some risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, and an unhealthy diet. Others you can&apost control, such as age and a family history of heart disease. Some people who have atherosclerosis have no signs or symptoms. They may not be diagnosed until after a heart attack or stroke. The main treatment for atherosclerosis is lifestyle changes. You also may need medicines and medical procedures. These treatments, along with ongoing medical care, can help you live a healthier life. Outlook Improved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosis-related diseases. These treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases. However, atherosclerosis remains a common health problem. You may be able to prevent or delay atherosclerosis and the diseases it can cause. Making lifestyle changes and getting ongoing care can help you avoid the problems of atherosclerosis and live a long, healthy life.
0.666666666667	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis (LIVING WITH): Improved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosis-related diseases. These treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases. Adopting a healthy lifestyle may help you prevent or delay atherosclerosis and the problems it can cause. This, along with ongoing medical care, can help you avoid the problems of atherosclerosis and live a long, healthy life. Researchers continue to look for ways to improve the health of people who have atherosclerosis or may develop it. Ongoing Care If you have atherosclerosis, work closely with your doctor and other health care providers to avoid serious problems, such as heart attack and stroke. Follow your treatment plan and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. Your doctor will let you know how often you should schedule office visits or blood tests. Be sure to let your doctor know if you have new or worsening symptoms. Emotional Issues and Support Having an atherosclerosis-related disease may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your doctor. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you&aposre very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Community resources are available to help you learn more about atherosclerosis. Contact your local public health departments, hospitals, and local chapters of national health organizations to learn more about available resources in your area. Talk about your lifestyle changes with your family and friends—whoever can provide support or needs to understand why you&aposre changing your habits. Family and friends may be able to help you make lifestyle changes. For example, they can help you plan healthier meals. Because atherosclerosis tends to run in families, your lifestyle changes may help many of your family members too.
0.777777777778	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis (WHO IS AT RISK): The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn&apost known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you&aposll develop atherosclerosis. You can control most risk factors and help prevent or delay atherosclerosis. Other risk factors can&apost be controlled. Major Risk Factors Unhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called "bad" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called "good" cholesterol). High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury—the units used to measure blood pressure.) Smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, raise cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesn&apost allow enough oxygen to reach the body&aposs tissues. Insulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can&apost use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it&aposs used as an energy source. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes. Diabetes. With this disease, the body&aposs blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn&apost make enough insulin or doesn&apost use its insulin properly. Overweight or obesity. The terms "overweight" and "obesity" refer to body weight that&aposs greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. Lack of physical activity. A lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight and obesity. Unhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other atherosclerosis risk factors. Older age. As you get older, your risk for atherosclerosis increases. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age. By the time you&aposre middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs or symptoms. In men, the risk increases after age 45. In women, the risk increases after age 55. Family history of early heart disease. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Although age and a family history of early heart disease are risk factors, it doesn&apost mean that you&aposll develop atherosclerosis if you have one or both. Controlling other risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent atherosclerosis, even in older adults. Studies show that an increasing number of children and youth are at risk for atherosclerosis. This is due to a number of causes, including rising childhood obesity rates. Emerging Risk Factors Scientists continue to study other possible risk factors for atherosclerosis. High levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood may raise the risk for atherosclerosis and heart attack. High levels of CRP are a sign of inflammation in the body. Inflammation is the body&aposs response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries&apos inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow. People who have low CRP levels may develop atherosclerosis at a slower rate than people who have high CRP levels. Research is under way to find out whether reducing inflammation and lowering CRP levels also can reduce the risk for atherosclerosis. High levels of triglycerides (tri-GLIH-seh-rides) in the blood also may raise the risk for atherosclerosis, especially in women. Triglycerides are a type of fat. Studies are under way to find out whether genetics may play a role in atherosclerosis risk. Other Factors That Affect Atherosclerosis Other factors also may raise your risk for atherosclerosis, such as: Sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke. Stress. Research shows that the most commonly reported "trigger" for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger. Alcohol. Heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle and worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day.

0.333333333333	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis (TREATMENTS): Treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include: Lowering the risk of blood clots forming Preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque Relieving symptoms Widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. Medicines Sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke Diabetes High LDL cholesterol levels Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: Lower your blood pressure Lower your blood sugar levels Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke Prevent inflammation Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis. Medical Procedures and Surgery If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that’s used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg. Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.
0.444444444444	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Hardening of the arteries (Outlook (Prognosis)): Hardening of the arteries cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, lifestyle changes and treating high cholesterol levels can prevent or slow the process from becoming worse. This can help reduce the chances of having a heart attack and stroke as a result of atherosclerosis.
-0.888888888889	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis (Symptoms): Atherosclerosis develops gradually. Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn&apost have any symptoms. You usually won&apost have atherosclerosis symptoms until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can&apost supply adequate blood to your organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow, or even breaks apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example: - If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure (angina). - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have signs and symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which, if left untreated, may progress to a stroke. - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication). - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you develop high blood pressure or kidney failure. When to see a doctor If you think you have atherosclerosis, talk to your doctor. Also pay attention to early symptoms of inadequate blood flow, such as chest pain (angina), leg pain or numbness. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from worsening and prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency.
-0.777777777778	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis (CAUSES): The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn&apost known. However, studies show that atherosclerosis is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. It develops faster as you age. Atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include: Smoking High amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood High blood pressure High amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes Plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). When this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots. Clots narrow the arteries even more, limiting the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. Depending on which arteries are affected, blood clots can worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack or stroke. Researchers continue to look for the causes of atherosclerosis. They hope to find answers to questions such as: Why and how do the arteries become damaged? How does plaque develop and change over time? Why does plaque rupture and lead to blood clots?
0.555555555556	how to prevent atherosclerosis	Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis: Arteriosclerosis occurs when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from your heart to the rest of your body (arteries) become thick and stiff - sometimes restricting blood flow to your organs and tissues. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic, but over time, the walls in your arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, but the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Atherosclerosis refers to the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on your artery walls (plaques), which can restrict blood flow. These plaques can burst, triggering a blood clot. Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart problem, it can affect arteries anywhere in your body. Atherosclerosis may be preventable and is treatable. Atherosclerosis develops gradually. Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn&apost have any symptoms. You usually won&apost have atherosclerosis symptoms until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can&apost supply adequate blood to your organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow, or even breaks apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example: - If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure (angina). - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have signs and symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which, if left untreated, may progress to a stroke. - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication). - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you develop high blood pressure or kidney failure. When to see a doctor If you think you have atherosclerosis, talk to your doctor. Also pay attention to early symptoms of inadequate blood flow, such as chest pain (angina), leg pain or numbness. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from worsening and prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency. Atherosclerosis is a slow, progressive disease that may begin as early as childhood. Although the exact cause is unknown, atherosclerosis may start with damage or injury to the inner layer of an artery. The damage may be caused by: - High blood pressure - High cholesterol - High triglycerides, a type of fat (lipid) in your blood - Smoking and other sources of tobacco - Insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes - Inflammation from diseases, such as arthritis, lupus or infections, or inflammation of unknown cause Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, blood cells and other substances often clump at the injury site and build up in the inner lining of the artery. Over time, fatty deposits (plaques) made of cholesterol and other cellular products also build up at the injury site and harden, narrowing your arteries. The organs and tissues connected to the blocked arteries then don&apost receive enough blood to function properly. Eventually, pieces of the fatty deposits may break off and enter your bloodstream. In addition, the smooth lining of a plaque may rupture, spilling cholesterol and other substances into your bloodstream. This may cause a blood clot, which can block the blood flow to a specific part of your body, such as occurs when blocked blood flow to your heart causes a heart attack. A blood clot can also travel to other parts of your body, blocking flow to another organ. Hardening of the arteries occurs over time. Besides aging, factors that increase the risk of atherosclerosis include: - High blood pressure - High cholesterol - Diabetes - Obesity - Smoking and other tobacco use - A family history of early heart disease - Lack of exercise - An unhealthy diet The complications of atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are blocked. For example: - Coronary artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your heart, you may develop coronary artery disease, which can cause chest pain (angina), a heart attack or heart failure. - Carotid artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your brain, you may develop carotid artery disease, which can cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. - Peripheral artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries in your arms or legs, you may develop circulation problems in your arms and legs called peripheral artery disease. This can make you less sensitive to heat and cold, increasing your risk of burns or frostbite. In rare cases, poor circulation in your arms or legs can cause tissue death (gangrene). - Aneurysms. Atherosclerosis can also cause aneurysms, a serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. Most people with aneurysms have no symptoms. Pain and throbbing in the area of an aneurysm may occur and is a medical emergency. If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding. Although this is usually a sudden, catastrophic event, a slow leak is possible. If a blood clot within an aneurysm dislodges, it may block an artery at some distant point. - Chronic kidney disease. Atherosclerosis can cause the arteries leading to your kidneys to narrow, preventing oxygenated blood from reaching them. Over time, this can affect your kidney function, keeping waste from exiting your body. During a physical exam, your doctor may find signs of narrowed, enlarged or hardened arteries, including: - A weak or absent pulse below the narrowed area of your artery - Decreased blood pressure in an affected limb - Whooshing sounds (bruits) over your arteries, heard using a stethoscope Depending on the results of the physical exam, your doctor may suggest one or more diagnostic tests, including: - Blood tests. Lab tests can detect increased levels of cholesterol and blood sugar that may increase the risk of atherosclerosis. You&aposll need to go without eating or drinking anything but water for nine to 12 hours before your blood test. Your doctor should tell you ahead of time if this test will be performed during your visit. - Doppler ultrasound. Your doctor may use a special ultrasound device (Doppler ultrasound) to measure your blood pressure at various points along your arm or leg. These measurements can help your doctor gauge the degree of any blockages, as well as the speed of blood flow in your arteries. - Ankle-brachial index. This test can tell if you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your legs and feet. Your doctor may compare the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm. This is known as the ankle-brachial index. An abnormal difference may indicate peripheral vascular disease, which is usually caused by atherosclerosis. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). An electrocardiogram records electrical signals as they travel through your heart. An ECG can often reveal evidence of a previous heart attack. If your signs and symptoms occur most often during exercise, your doctor may ask you to walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike during an ECG. - Stress test. A stress test, also called an exercise stress test, is used to gather information about how well your heart works during physical activity. Because exercise makes your heart pump harder and faster than it does during most daily activities, an exercise stress test can reveal problems within your heart that might not be noticeable otherwise. An exercise stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while your heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing are monitored. In some types of stress tests, pictures will be taken of your heart, such as during a stress echocardiogram (ultrasound) or nuclear stress test. If you&aposre unable to exercise, you may receive a medication that mimics the effect of exercise on your heart. - Cardiac catheterization and angiogram. This test can show if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked. A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that&aposs fed through an artery, usually in your leg, to the arteries in your heart. As the dye fills your arteries, the arteries become visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. - Other imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to study your arteries. These tests can often show hardening and narrowing of large arteries, as well as aneurysms and calcium deposits in the artery walls. Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising, are often the most appropriate treatment for atherosclerosis. Sometimes, medication or surgical procedures may be recommended as well. Medications Various drugs can slow - or even reverse - the effects of atherosclerosis. Here are some common choices: - Cholesterol medications. Aggressively lowering your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the "bad" cholesterol, can slow, stop or even reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries. Boosting your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, may help, too. Your doctor can choose from a range of cholesterol medications, including drugs known as statins and fibrates. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins have additional effects that help stabilize the lining of your heart arteries and prevent atherosclerosis. - Anti-platelet medications. Your doctor may prescribe anti-platelet medications, such as aspirin, to reduce the likelihood that platelets will clump in narrowed arteries, form a blood clot and cause further blockage. - Beta blocker medications. These medications are commonly used for coronary artery disease. They lower your heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the demand on your heart and often relieve symptoms of chest pain. Beta blockers reduce the risk of heart attacks and some heart rhythm problems. - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These medications may help slow the progression of atherosclerosis by lowering blood pressure and producing other beneficial effects on the heart arteries. ACE inhibitors can also reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks. - Calcium channel blockers. These medications lower blood pressure and are sometimes used to treat angina. - Water pills (diuretics). High blood pressure is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Diuretics lower blood pressure. - Other medications. Your doctor may suggest certain medications to control specific risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as diabetes. Sometimes specific medications to treat symptoms of atherosclerosis, such as leg pain during exercise, are prescribed. Surgical procedures Sometimes more aggressive treatment is needed to treat atherosclerosis. If you have severe symptoms or a blockage that threatens muscle or skin tissue survival, you may be a candidate for one of the following surgical procedures: - Angioplasty and stent placement. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a long, thin tube (catheter) into the blocked or narrowed part of your artery. A second catheter with a deflated balloon on its tip is then passed through the catheter to the narrowed area. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the deposits against your artery walls. A mesh tube (stent) is usually left in the artery to help keep the artery open. - Endarterectomy. In some cases, fatty deposits must be surgically removed from the walls of a narrowed artery. When the procedure is done on arteries in the neck (the carotid arteries), it&aposs called a carotid endarterectomy. - Fibrinolytic therapy. If you have an artery that&aposs blocked by a blood clot, your doctor may use a clot-dissolving drug to break it apart. - Bypass surgery. Your doctor may create a graft bypass using a vessel from another part of your body or a tube made of synthetic fabric. This allows blood to flow around the blocked or narrowed artery. Lifestyle changes can help you prevent or slow the progression of atherosclerosis. - Stop smoking. Smoking damages your arteries. If you smoke or use tobacco in any form, quitting is the best way to halt the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce your risk of complications. - Exercise most days of the week. Regular exercise can condition your muscles to use oxygen more efficiently. Physical activity can also improve circulation and promote development of new blood vessels that form a natural bypass around obstructions (collateral vessels). Exercise helps lower blood pressure and reduces your risk of diabetes. Aim to exercise at least 30 minutes most days of the week. If you can&apost fit it all into one session, try breaking it up into 10-minute intervals. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk around the block during your lunch hour, or do some situps or pushups while watching television. - Eat healthy foods. A heart-healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables and whole grains - and low in refined carbohydrates, sugars, saturated fat and sodium - can help you control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Try substituting whole-grain bread in place of white bread; grabbing an apple, a banana or carrot sticks as a snack; and reading nutrition labels as a guide to controlling the amount of salt and fat you eat. Use monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, and reduce or eliminate sugar and sugar substitutes. - Lose extra pounds and maintain a healthy weight. If you&aposre overweight, losing as few as 5 to 10 pounds (about 2.3 to 4.5 kilograms) can help reduce your risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, two of the major risk factors for developing atherosclerosis. Losing weight helps reduce your risk of diabetes or control your condition if you already have diabetes. - Manage stress. Reduce stress as much as possible. Practice healthy techniques for managing stress, such as muscle relaxation and deep breathing. If you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or another chronic disease, work with your doctor to manage the condition and promote overall health. It&aposs thought that some foods and herbal supplements can help reduce your high cholesterol level and high blood pressure, two major risk factors for developing atherosclerosis. With your doctor&aposs OK, you might consider these supplements and products: - Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) - Barley - Beta-sitosterol (found in oral supplements and some margarines, such as Promise Activ) - Black tea - Blond psyllium (found in seed husk and products such as Metamucil) - Calcium - Cocoa - Cod liver oil - Coenzyme Q10 - Fish oil - Folic acid - Garlic - Green tea - Oat bran (found in oatmeal and whole oats) - Sitostanol (found in oral supplements and some margarines, such as Benecol) - Vitamin C Talk to your doctor before adding any of these supplements to your atherosclerosis treatment. Some supplements can interact with medications, causing harmful side effects. You can also practice relaxation techniques, such as yoga or deep breathing, to help you relax and reduce your stress level. These practices can temporarily reduce your blood pressure, reducing your risk of developing atherosclerosis.
0.8	how to prevent conjunctivitis	Neonatal conjunctivitis (Prevention): Pregnant women should get treatment for diseases spread through sexual contact to prevent newborn conjunctivitis caused by these infections. Putting eye drops into all infants&apos eyes in the delivery room right after birth can help prevent many infections. (Most states have laws requiring this treatment.) When a mother has active herpes sores at the time of delivery, a Cesarean section (C-section) is recommended to prevent serious illness in the baby.

-0.4	how to prevent conjunctivitis	Ligneous conjunctivitis (Summary): Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare disorder characterized by the buildup of a protein called fibrin which causes inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) and leads to thick, woody (ligneous), inflamed growths that are yellow, white, or red. Ligneous conjunctivitis most often occurs on the inside of the eyelids, but may also affect the sclera, cornea and pupil, leading to vision loss. [1] A systemic form of the condition may occur, affecting the mucous membranes of the larynx, vocal chords, nose, trachea, bronchi, vagina, cervix, and gingiva. The cause of ligneous conjunctivitis is unknown.  Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested in some cases. [2] Ligneous conjunctivitis is sometimes associated with a condition known as congenital plasminogen deficiency.

2.0	how to prevent conjunctivitis	Conjunctivitis or pink eye (Prevention): Good hygiene can help prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. Things you can do include: - Change pillowcases often. - DO NOT share eye makeup and replace it regularly. - DO NOT share towels or handkerchiefs. - Handle and clean contact lenses properly. - Keep hands away from the eye. - Wash your hands often.
0.7	how to prevent conjunctivitis	Neonatal conjunctivitis: Conjunctivitis is swelling or infection of the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye. Conjunctivitis may occur in a newborn child. Swollen or inflamed eyes are most commonly caused by: - A blocked tear duct - Eye drops with antibiotics, given right after birth - Infection by bacteria or viruses Bacteria that normally live in a woman&aposs vagina may be passed to the baby during childbirth. More serious eye damage may be caused by: - Gonorrhea and chlamydia: These are infections spread from sexual contact. - The viruses that cause genital and oral herpes: These may lead to severe eye damage. Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia. The mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery. She still may carry bacteria or viruses that can cause this problem. Infected newborn infants develop drainage from the eyes within 1 day to 2 weeks after birth. The eyelids become puffy, red, and tender. There may be watery, bloody, or thick pus-like drainage from the infant&aposs eyes. The health care provider will perform an eye exam on the baby. If the eye does not appear normal, the following tests may be done: - Culture of the drainage from the eye to look for bacteria or viruses - Slit-lamp exam to look for damage to the surface of the eyeball Eye swelling that is caused by the eye drops given at birth should go away on its own. For a blocked tear duct, gentle warm massage between the eye and nasal area may help. This is most often tried before starting antibiotics. Surgery may be needed if a blocked tear duct has not cleared up by the time the baby is 1 year old. Antibiotics are often needed for eye infections caused by bacteria. Eye drops and ointments may also be used. Salt water eye drops may be used to remove sticky yellow drainage. Special antiviral eye drops or ointments are used for herpes infections of the eye. Quick diagnosis and treatment usually leads to good outcomes. Complications may include: - Blindness - Inflammation of the iris - Scar or hole in the cornea -- the clear structure that is over the colored part of the eye (the iris) Talk to your provider if you have given birth (or expect to give birth) in a place where antibiotic or silver nitrate drops are not routinely placed in the infant&aposs eyes. An example would be having an unsupervised birth at home. This is very important if you have or are at risk for any sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get treatment for diseases spread through sexual contact to prevent newborn conjunctivitis caused by these infections. Putting eye drops into all infants&apos eyes in the delivery room right after birth can help prevent many infections. (Most states have laws requiring this treatment.) When a mother has active herpes sores at the time of delivery, a Cesarean section (C-section) is recommended to prevent serious illness in the baby. Updated by: Neil K.

-1.6	how to prevent conjunctivitis	Trachoma (When to Contact a Medical Professional): Call your provider if you or your child recently visited an area where trachoma is common and you notice symptoms of conjunctivitis.
-1.7	how to prevent conjunctivitis	Trachoma: Trachoma is an infection of the eye caused by bacteria called chlamydia. Trachoma is caused by infection with the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. The condition occurs around the world. It is most often seen in rural areas of developing countries. Children are often affected. However, the scarring caused by the infection may not be noticed until later in life. The condition is rare in the United States. However, it is more likely to occur in crowded or unclean living conditions. Trachoma is spread through direct contact with infected eye, nose, or throat fluids. It can also be passed by contact with contaminated objects, such as towels or clothes. Certain flies can also spread the bacteria. Symptoms begin 5 to 12 days after being exposed to the bacteria. The condition begins slowly. It first appears as inflammation of the tissue lining the eyelids (conjunctivitis, or "pink eye"). Untreated, this may lead to scarring. Symptoms may include: - Cloudy cornea - Discharge from the eye - Swelling of lymph nodes just in front of the ears - Swollen eyelids - Turned-in eyelashes The health care provider will do an eye exam to look for scarring on the inside of the upper eye lid, redness of the white part of the eyes, and new blood vessel growth into the cornea. Lab tests are needed to identify the bacteria and make an accurate diagnosis. Antibiotics can prevent long-term complications if used early in the infection. In certain cases, eyelid surgery may be needed to prevent long-term scarring, which can lead to blindness if not corrected. Outcomes are very good if treatment is started early before scarring and changes to the eyelids develop. If the eyelids become very irritated, the eyelashes may turn in and rub against the cornea. This can cause corneal ulcers, additional scars, vision loss, and possibly, blindness. Call your provider if you or your child recently visited an area where trachoma is common and you notice symptoms of conjunctivitis. Spread of the infection can be limited by washing your hands and face often, keeping clothes clean, and not sharing items such as towels. Updated by: Franklin W.

1.90909090909	how to prevent diabetes	How to Prevent Diabetes (Summary): Summary What is type 2 diabetes? If you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, this happens because your body does not make enough insulin, or it does not use insulin well (this is called insulin resistance). If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you might be able to prevent or delay developing it. Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes? Many Americans are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Your chances of getting it depend on a combination of risk factors such as your genes and lifestyle. The risk factors include - Having prediabetes, which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes - Being overweight or having obesity - Being age 45 or older - A family history of diabetes - Being African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander - Having high blood pressure - Having a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglycerides - A history of diabetes in pregnancy - Having given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more - An inactive lifestyle - A history of heart disease or stroke - Having depression - Having polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - Having acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick, especially around your neck or armpits - Smoking How can I prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes? If you are at risk for diabetes, you may be able to prevent or delay getting it. Most of the things that you need to do involve having a healthier lifestyle. So if you make these changes, you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases, and you will probably feel better and have more energy. The changes are - Losing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10 percent of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don&apost gain it back. - Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It&aposs also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats. - Get regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal. - Don&apost smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit. - Talk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

-1.72727272727	how to prevent diabetes	Aspirin to Prevent a First Heart Attack or Stroke: Also known as aspirin primary prevention. Aspirin is a proven way to help some people prevent a second heart attack or stroke. When aspirin is used this way it is called aspirin secondary prevention. It appears that aspirin also may help prevent a first heart attack or stroke in some people. Learn more about what we know about aspirin primary prevention, or the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Who may benefit? Aspirin primary prevention is not right for everyone. Aspirin primary prevention may be beneficial for adults who: Are 50 to 69 years old, with the greatest benefit for adults aged 50 to 59; Have a 10 percent or higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years; and Are able and willing to take low-dose aspirin, about 81 mg per day, for at least 10 years. Currently, there is not enough evidence to: Support the use of aspirin primary prevention in patients who are younger than 50 years or older than 70 years. Know whether aspirin primary prevention benefits or risks differ between men and women or between different races or ethnicities. Talk to your doctor to find out whether aspirin is right for you to help prevent heart attack, stroke, or other conditions. Do not start aspirin without first talking with your doctor about your risks and benefits. There are conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis, where aspirin alone would not be enough protection. If you have either of these conditions, be sure to talk with your doctor about what prevention method is best for you. Read more Why does aspirin prevent heart attack and stroke? Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain. But, aspirin also may prevent the formation of blood clots. Aspirin does this by inhibiting platelets from promoting clotting in blood vessels where cholesterol and plaque may be partially blocking blood flow. This clotting can lead to heart attack and stroke. By inhibiting clotting, aspirin helps reduce damage to the heart and brain and helps prevent heart attack and stroke. What are the risks? Bleeding is the most common side effect of aspirin. The risk of bleeding is higher in men versus women, and the risk increases in patients who: Are older Are using aspirin at a higher dose or for longer periods of time Are using aspirin at the same time as other medicines that increase the risk of bleeding Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have or previously had ulcers in their gastrointestinal tract Have other medical conditions such as kidney failure, liver disease, and certain bleeding or blood disorders Some patients with severe asthma may be sensitive to aspirin. These patients may experience serious respiratory problems when taking aspirin. Talk to your doctor to find out whether aspirin is right for you. Don’t start taking aspirin without first talking to your doctor. Read more Why does aspirin cause bleeding as a side effect and is it serious? Aspirin can cause bleeding in many parts of the body, particularly in the brain or in the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach. This can happen because aspirin can make it easier for the stomach lining to be damaged and bleed. Because aspirin also inhibits clotting, bleeding in the stomach or brain can be fatal if left untreated and it requires immediate medical attention. What if I’m taking aspirin to prevent another heart attack or stroke? The information discussed in Who may benefit? only applies to use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Aspirin is a proven way to prevent a second heart attack or stroke in some people. If you’ve already had a heart attack or stroke and are already taking aspirin to prevent another event, do not stop taking your aspirin without talking to your doctor. How else can you prevent heart attack and stroke? Heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent a heart attack and stroke. These changes include: Heart-healthy eating Being physically active Quitting smoking Managing stress Aiming for a health weight It is also important to control other medical conditions that increase your risk of heart attack or stroke, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, preeclampsia, and overweight and obesity. You and your doctor should monitor your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar numbers to know if you are at risk for a first heart attack or stroke or if you are meeting goals to help prevent another event.

-1.90909090909	how to prevent diabetes	How to prevent frostbite and hypothermia: If you work or play outside during the winter, you need to know how cold affects your body. Being active in the cold can put you at risk for problems such as hypothermia and frostbite. Cold temperatures, wind, rain, and even sweat cool your skin and pull heat away from your body. You also lose heat when you breathe and sit or stand on the cold ground or other cold surfaces. In cold weather, your body tries to keep a warm inner (core) temperature to protect your vital organs. It does this by slowing blood circulation in your face, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The skin and tissues in these areas becomes colder. This puts you at risk for frostbite. If your core body temperature drops just a few degrees, hypothermia will set in. With even mild hypothermia, your brain and body DO NOT work as well. Severe hypothermia can lead to death. Dress in Layers They key to staying safe in the cold is to wear several layers of clothing. Wearing the right shoes and clothes helps: - Keep your body heat trapped inside your clothes - Protect you from cold air, wind, snow, or rain - Protect you from contact with cold surfaces You may need several layers of clothing in cold weather: - An inner layer that wicks sweat away from the skin. It can be lightweight wool, polyester, or polypropylene (polypro). Never wear cotton in cold weather, including your underwear. Cotton absorbs moisture and keeps it next to your skin, making you cold. - Middle layers that insulate and keep heat in. They can be polyester fleece, wool, microfiber insulation, or down. Depending on your activity, you may need a couple of insulating layers. - An outer layer that repels wind, snow, and rain. Try to choose a fabric that is both breathable and rain and wind proof. If your outer layer is not also breathable, sweat can build up and make you cold. You also need to protect your hands, feet, neck, and face. Depending on your activity, you may need the following: - Warm hat - Face mask - Scarf or neck warmer - Mittens or gloves (mittens tend to be warmer) - Wool or polypro socks - Warm, waterproof shoes or boots The key with all of your layers is to take them off as you warm up and add them back as you cool down. If you wear too much while exercising, you will sweat a lot, which can make you colder. You need both food and fluids to fuel your body and keep you warm. If you skimp on either, you increase your risk for cold weather injuries such as hypothermia and frostbite. Eating foods with carbohydrates gives you quick energy. If you are only out for a short time, you may want to carry a snack bar to keep your energy going. If you are out all day skiing, hiking, or working, be sure to bring food with protein and fat as well to fuel you over many hours. Drink plenty of fluids before and during activities in the cold. You may not feel as thirsty in cold weather, but you still lose fluids through your sweat and when you breathe. Be aware of the early signs of cold weather injuries. Frostbite and hypothermia can occur at the same time. The early stage of frostbite is called frostnip. Signs include: - Red and cold skin; skin may start to turn white, but is still soft - Prickling and numbness - Tingling - Stinging Early warning signs of hypothermia include: - Feeling cold - Shivering - The "Umbles:" stumbles, bumbles, grumbles, and mumbles. These are signs that cold is affecting your body and brain. To prevent more serious problems, take action as soon as you notice early signs of frostbite or hypothermia. - Get out of the cold, wind, rain, or snow if possible. - Add warm layers of clothing. - Eat carbohydrates. - Drink fluids. - Move your body to help warm your core. Do jumping jacks or flap your arms. - Warm up any area with frostnip. Remove tight jewelry or clothing. Place cold fingers in your armpits, or warm a cold nose or cheek with the palm of your warm hand. DO NOT rub. You should call your health care provider or get medical help right away if you or someone in your party: - Does not get better or gets worse after attempting to warm up or to rewarm frostnip. - Has frostbite. NEVER rewarm frostbite on your own. It can be very painful and damaging. - Shows signs of hypothermia Updated by: Jacob L.

0.454545454545	how to prevent diabetes	Preventing Diabetes Problems (How can I prevent hypoglycemia if I have diabetes?): If you are taking insulin, a sulfonylurea, or a meglitinide, using your diabetes management plan and working with your health care team to adjust your plan as needed can help you prevent hypoglycemia. The following actions can also help prevent hypoglycemia:Knowing your blood glucose level can help you decide how much medicine to take, what food to eat, and how physically active to be. To find out your blood glucose level, check yourself with a blood glucose meter as often as your doctor advises.Hypoglycemia unawareness. Sometimes people with diabetes don’t feel or recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia, a problem called hypoglycemia unawareness. If you have had hypoglycemia without feeling any symptoms, you may need to check your blood glucose more often so you know when you need to treat your hypoglycemia or take steps to prevent it. Be sure to check your blood glucose before you drive.If you have hypoglycemia unawareness or have hypoglycemia often, ask your health care provider about a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM checks your blood glucose level at regular times throughout the day and night. CGMs can tell you if your blood glucose is falling quickly and sound an alarm if your blood glucose falls too low. CGM alarms can wake you up if you have hypoglycemia during sleep.Your meal plan is key to preventing hypoglycemia. Eat regular meals and snacks with the correct amount of carbohydrates to help keep your blood glucose level from going too low. Also, if you drink alcoholic beverages, it’s best to eat some food at the same time.Physical activity can lower your blood glucose during the activity and for hours afterward. To help prevent hypoglycemia, you may need to check your blood glucose before, during, and after physical activity and adjust your medicine or carbohydrate intake. For example, you might eat a snack before being physically active or decrease your insulin dose as directed by your health care provider to keep your blood glucose from dropping too low.Tell your health care team if you have had hypoglycemia. Your health care team may adjust your diabetes medicines or other aspects of your management plan. Learn about balancing your medicines, eating plan, and physical activity to prevent hypoglycemia. Ask if you should have a glucagon emergency kit to carry with you at all times.

-0.6	how to prevent lung cancer	Lung cancer (Summary): Lung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs. The lungs are located in the chest. When you breathe, air goes through your nose, down your windpipe (trachea), and into the lungs, where it flows through tubes called bronchi. Most lung cancer begins in the cells that line these tubes. There are 2 main types of lung cancer: - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up about 20% of all lung cancer cases. If the lung cancer is made up of both types, it is called mixed small cell/large cell cancer. If the cancer started somewhere else in the body and spreads to the lungs, it is called metastatic cancer to the lung.
0.8	how to prevent lung cancer	Lung cancer (Causes): Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk of lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Lung cancer can also affect people who have never smoked. Secondhand smoke (breathing the smoke of others) increases your risk of lung cancer. The following may also increase your risk of lung cancer: - Exposure to asbestos. - Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust. - Exposure to radon gas. - Family history of lung cancer. - High levels of air pollution. - High levels of arsenic in drinking water. - Radiation therapy to the lungs.
-0.8	how to prevent lung cancer	Lung Cancer (General Information About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer): - Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. - There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer. - Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer. - Signs of non-small cell lung cancer include a cough that doesn&apost go away and shortness of breath. - Tests that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - For most patients with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
2.0	how to prevent schizophrenia	Schizophrenia (Prevention): Schizophrenia cannot be prevented. Symptoms may be prevented by taking medicine exactly as the doctor instructed. Symptoms are likely to return if medicine is stopped. Changing or stopping medicines should only be done by the doctor who prescribed them.
-0.333333333333	how to prevent schizophrenia	Schizophrenia (Treatment): During an episode of schizophrenia, the person may need to stay in the hospital for safety reasons. MEDICINES Antipsychotic drugs are the most effective treatment for schizophrenia. They change the balance of chemicals in the brain and can help control symptoms. These drugs can cause side effects, but many side effects can be managed. Side effects should not prevent the person from getting treated for this serious condition. Common side effects from antipsychotics may include: - Dizziness - Feelings of restlessness or jitteriness - Sleepiness (sedation) - Slowed movements - Tremor - Weight gain Long-term use of antipsychotics may increase the risk of a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. This condition causes repeated movements that the person cannot control. Call the health care provider right away if you think you or your family member may have this condition due to the medicine. When schizophrenia does not improve with antipsychotics, other medicines may be tried. Schizophrenia is a life-long illness. Most people with this condition need to stay on antipsychotics for life. SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND THERAPIES Support therapy may be helpful for many people with schizophrenia. Behavioral techniques, such as social skills training, can help the person function better in social and work situations. Job training and relationship-building classes are also important. Family members and caregivers are very important during treatment. Therapy can teach important skills, such as: - Coping with symptoms that continue, even while taking medicines - Following a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep and staying away from recreational drugs - Taking medicines correctly and managing side effects - Watching for the return of symptoms, and knowing what to do when they return - Getting the right support services
0.888888888889	how to prevent schizophrenia	Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that makes it hard to tell the difference between what is real and not real. It also makes it hard to think clearly, have normal emotional responses, and act normally in social situations. Schizophrenia is a complex illness. Mental health experts are not sure what causes it. Genes may play a role. Schizophrenia occurs in just as many men as women. It usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it may begin later in life. In women, it tends to begin later and is a milder condition. Schizophrenia in children usually begins after age 5. Childhood schizophrenia is rare and can be hard to tell apart from other developmental problems, such as autism. Symptoms usually develop slowly over months or years. The person may have many symptoms, or only a few. People with schizophrenia may have trouble keeping friends and working. They may also have problems with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Early symptoms may include: - Irritable or tense feeling - Trouble concentrating - Trouble sleeping As the illness continues, the person may have problems with thinking, emotions, and behavior, including: - Hearing or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations) - Isolation - Reduced emotions in tone of voice or expression of face - Problems with understanding and making decisions - Problems paying attention and following through with activities - Strongly held beliefs that are not real (delusions) - Talking in a way that does not make sense - Thoughts that "jump" between different topics (loose associations) There are no medical tests to diagnose schizophrenia. A psychiatrist should examine the person and make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is made based on an interview of the person and family members. The psychiatrist will ask: - How long symptoms have lasted - How the person&aposs ability to function has changed - What the person&aposs developmental background was like - About the person&aposs genetic and family history - How well medicines have worked - Whether the person has problems with substance abuse - About any other medical conditions the person has Brain scans (such as CT or MRI) and blood tests may help rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms. During an episode of schizophrenia, the person may need to stay in the hospital for safety reasons. MEDICINES Antipsychotic drugs are the most effective treatment for schizophrenia.

Most of the time, symptoms improve with medicines. But many people may have trouble functioning. They are at risk of repeated episodes, especially during the early stages of the illness. People with schizophrenia may need housing, job training, and other community support programs. Those with the most severe forms of this disorder may not be able to live alone. They may need to live in group homes or other long-term, structured residences. Symptoms are very likely to return when medicine is stopped. Having schizophrenia increases the risk of: - Developing a problem with alcohol or drugs. Using these substances increases the chances that symptoms will return. - Physical illness. This is due to an inactive lifestyle and side effects of medicines. - Suicide Call your provider if you (or another family member): - Hear voices telling you to hurt yourself or others - Have the urge to hurt yourself or others - Feel scared or overwhelmed - See things that are not really there - Feel that you cannot leave the house - Feel that you are not able to care for yourself Schizophrenia cannot be prevented. Symptoms may be prevented by taking medicine exactly as the doctor instructed. Symptoms are likely to return if medicine is stopped. Changing or stopping medicines should only be done by the doctor who prescribed them. Updated by: Fred K. Berger, MD, addiction and forensic psychiatrist, Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla, CA.

-1.66666666667	how to prevent schizophrenia	Aspirin to Prevent a First Heart Attack or Stroke: Also known as aspirin primary prevention. Aspirin is a proven way to help some people prevent a second heart attack or stroke. When aspirin is used this way it is called aspirin secondary prevention. It appears that aspirin also may help prevent a first heart attack or stroke in some people. Learn more about what we know about aspirin primary prevention, or the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Who may benefit? Aspirin primary prevention is not right for everyone. Aspirin primary prevention may be beneficial for adults who: Are 50 to 69 years old, with the greatest benefit for adults aged 50 to 59; Have a 10 percent or higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years; and Are able and willing to take low-dose aspirin, about 81 mg per day, for at least 10 years. Currently, there is not enough evidence to: Support the use of aspirin primary prevention in patients who are younger than 50 years or older than 70 years. Know whether aspirin primary prevention benefits or risks differ between men and women or between different races or ethnicities. Talk to your doctor to find out whether aspirin is right for you to help prevent heart attack, stroke, or other conditions. Do not start aspirin without first talking with your doctor about your risks and benefits. There are conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis, where aspirin alone would not be enough protection. If you have either of these conditions, be sure to talk with your doctor about what prevention method is best for you. Read more Why does aspirin prevent heart attack and stroke? Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain. But, aspirin also may prevent the formation of blood clots. Aspirin does this by inhibiting platelets from promoting clotting in blood vessels where cholesterol and plaque may be partially blocking blood flow. This clotting can lead to heart attack and stroke. By inhibiting clotting, aspirin helps reduce damage to the heart and brain and helps prevent heart attack and stroke. What are the risks? Bleeding is the most common side effect of aspirin. The risk of bleeding is higher in men versus women, and the risk increases in patients who: Are older Are using aspirin at a higher dose or for longer periods of time Are using aspirin at the same time as other medicines that increase the risk of bleeding Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have or previously had ulcers in their gastrointestinal tract Have other medical conditions such as kidney failure, liver disease, and certain bleeding or blood disorders Some patients with severe asthma may be sensitive to aspirin. These patients may experience serious respiratory problems when taking aspirin. Talk to your doctor to find out whether aspirin is right for you. Don’t start taking aspirin without first talking to your doctor. Read more Why does aspirin cause bleeding as a side effect and is it serious? Aspirin can cause bleeding in many parts of the body, particularly in the brain or in the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach. This can happen because aspirin can make it easier for the stomach lining to be damaged and bleed. Because aspirin also inhibits clotting, bleeding in the stomach or brain can be fatal if left untreated and it requires immediate medical attention. What if I’m taking aspirin to prevent another heart attack or stroke? The information discussed in Who may benefit? only applies to use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Aspirin is a proven way to prevent a second heart attack or stroke in some people. If you’ve already had a heart attack or stroke and are already taking aspirin to prevent another event, do not stop taking your aspirin without talking to your doctor. How else can you prevent heart attack and stroke? Heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent a heart attack and stroke. These changes include: Heart-healthy eating Being physically active Quitting smoking Managing stress Aiming for a health weight It is also important to control other medical conditions that increase your risk of heart attack or stroke, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, preeclampsia, and overweight and obesity. You and your doctor should monitor your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar numbers to know if you are at risk for a first heart attack or stroke or if you are meeting goals to help prevent another event.

If your core body temperature drops just a few degrees, hypothermia will set in. With even mild hypothermia, your brain and body DO NOT work as well. Severe hypothermia can lead to death. Dress in Layers They key to staying safe in the cold is to wear several layers of clothing. Wearing the right shoes and clothes helps: - Keep your body heat trapped inside your clothes - Protect you from cold air, wind, snow, or rain - Protect you from contact with cold surfaces You may need several layers of clothing in cold weather: - An inner layer that wicks sweat away from the skin. It can be lightweight wool, polyester, or polypropylene (polypro). Never wear cotton in cold weather, including your underwear. Cotton absorbs moisture and keeps it next to your skin, making you cold. - Middle layers that insulate and keep heat in. They can be polyester fleece, wool, microfiber insulation, or down. Depending on your activity, you may need a couple of insulating layers. - An outer layer that repels wind, snow, and rain. Try to choose a fabric that is both breathable and rain and wind proof. If your outer layer is not also breathable, sweat can build up and make you cold. You also need to protect your hands, feet, neck, and face. Depending on your activity, you may need the following: - Warm hat - Face mask - Scarf or neck warmer - Mittens or gloves (mittens tend to be warmer) - Wool or polypro socks - Warm, waterproof shoes or boots The key with all of your layers is to take them off as you warm up and add them back as you cool down. If you wear too much while exercising, you will sweat a lot, which can make you colder. You need both food and fluids to fuel your body and keep you warm. If you skimp on either, you increase your risk for cold weather injuries such as hypothermia and frostbite. Eating foods with carbohydrates gives you quick energy. If you are only out for a short time, you may want to carry a snack bar to keep your energy going. If you are out all day skiing, hiking, or working, be sure to bring food with protein and fat as well to fuel you over many hours. Drink plenty of fluids before and during activities in the cold. You may not feel as thirsty in cold weather, but you still lose fluids through your sweat and when you breathe. Be aware of the early signs of cold weather injuries. Frostbite and hypothermia can occur at the same time. The early stage of frostbite is called frostnip. Signs include: - Red and cold skin; skin may start to turn white, but is still soft - Prickling and numbness - Tingling - Stinging Early warning signs of hypothermia include: - Feeling cold - Shivering - The "Umbles:" stumbles, bumbles, grumbles, and mumbles. These are signs that cold is affecting your body and brain. To prevent more serious problems, take action as soon as you notice early signs of frostbite or hypothermia. - Get out of the cold, wind, rain, or snow if possible. - Add warm layers of clothing. - Eat carbohydrates. - Drink fluids. - Move your body to help warm your core. Do jumping jacks or flap your arms. - Warm up any area with frostnip. Remove tight jewelry or clothing. Place cold fingers in your armpits, or warm a cold nose or cheek with the palm of your warm hand. DO NOT rub. You should call your health care provider or get medical help right away if you or someone in your party: - Does not get better or gets worse after attempting to warm up or to rewarm frostnip. - Has frostbite. NEVER rewarm frostbite on your own. It can be very painful and damaging. - Shows signs of hypothermia Updated by: Jacob L.

0.777777777778	how to prevent schizophrenia	Childhood schizophrenia (Lifestyle and home remedies): Although childhood schizophrenia requires professional treatment, it&aposs critical to be an active participant in your child&aposs care. Here are ways to get the most out of the treatment plan. - Follow directions for medications. Try to make sure that your child takes medications as prescribed, even if he or she is feeling well and has no current symptoms. If medications are stopped or taken infrequently, the symptoms are likely to come back and your doctor will have a hard time knowing what the best and safest dose is. - Check first before taking other medications. Contact the doctor who&aposs treating your child for schizophrenia before your child takes medications prescribed by another doctor or before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, minerals, herbs or other supplements. These can interact with schizophrenia medications. - Pay attention to warning signs. You and your child may have identified things that may trigger symptoms, cause a relapse or prevent your child from carrying out daily activities. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your child&aposs doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms, to prevent the situation from worsening. - Make physical activity and healthy eating a priority. Some medications for schizophrenia are associated with an increased risk of weight gain and high cholesterol in children. Work with your child&aposs doctor to make a nutrition and physical activity plan for your child that will help manage weight and benefit heart health. - Avoid alcohol, street drugs and tobacco. Alcohol, street drugs and tobacco can worsen schizophrenia symptoms or interfere with antipsychotic medications. Talk to your child about avoiding drugs and alcohol and not smoking. If necessary, get appropriate treatment for a substance use problem.
-0.555555555556	how to prevent schizophrenia	Schizophrenia (Possible Complications): Having schizophrenia increases the risk of: - Developing a problem with alcohol or drugs. Using these substances increases the chances that symptoms will return. - Physical illness. This is due to an inactive lifestyle and side effects of medicines. - Suicide
1.85714285714	how to treat a heart attack	Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&aposs blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&aposll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&aposll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less "sticky" and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&aposs job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&aposs passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&aposve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&aposre likely to remain in the hospital for several days.
2.0	how to treat a heart attack	Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn&apost have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
-0.714285714286	how to treat a heart attack	What is Heart Attack?: A heart attack occurs when the supply of blood and oxygen to an area of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery. If the blockage is not treated within a few hours, the heart muscle will be permanently damaged and replaced by scar tissue.
0.714285714286	how to treat a heart attack	Heart attack (Lifestyle and home remedies): Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart&aposs health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn&apost be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.
-0.571428571429	how to treat a heart attack	What is Heart Attack?: Angina is a recurring pain or discomfort in the chest that happens when some part of the heart does not receive enough blood. An episode of angina is not a heart attack. However, people with angina may have a hard time telling the difference between angina and heart attack symptoms. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle does not get enough blood. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It may also feel like indigestion. It is usually relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medicine.
0.571428571429	how to treat a heart attack	What is Heart Attack?: Having a heart attack increases your chances of having another one. Therefore, it is very important that you and your family know how and when to seek medical attention. Talk to your doctor about making an emergency action plan, and discuss it with your family. The emergency action plan should include - warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack - instructions for accessing emergency medical services in your community, including calling 9-1-1 - steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive, such as taking aspirin and nitroglycerin - important information to take along with you to the hospital, such as a list of medications that you take or that you are allergic to, and name and number of whom you should contact if you go to the hospital. warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack instructions for accessing emergency medical services in your community, including calling 9-1-1 steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive, such as taking aspirin and nitroglycerin important information to take along with you to the hospital, such as a list of medications that you take or that you are allergic to, and name and number of whom you should contact if you go to the hospital.

2.0	what are autoimmune blood disorders	Autoimmune disorders: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body&aposs immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders. The blood cells in the body&aposs immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: - The destruction of body tissue - Abnormal growth of an organ - Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: - Blood vessels - Connective tissues - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas - Joints - Muscles - Red blood cells - Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: - Addison disease - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) - Dermatomyositis - Graves disease - Hashimoto thyroiditis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Pernicious anemia - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sjögren syndrome - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - General ill-feeling (malaise) - Joint pain - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease. Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: - Antinuclear antibody tests - Autoantibody tests - CBC - Comprehensive metabolic panel - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to: - Reduce symptoms - Control the autoimmune process - Maintain the body&aposs ability to fight disease Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease - Blood transfusions if blood is affected - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system&aposs abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

-1.57142857143	what are autoimmune blood disorders	PANDAS: PANDAS is an acronym for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder  Associated with Streptococcus. It is used to describe a condition in children whose symptoms of  obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or a tic disorder (i.e.  Tourette syndrome) are worsened by  group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. The underlying cause of PANDAS is unclear, but studies suggest that a strep infection causes an abnormal  immune response resulting in neuropsychiatric symptoms. The association between PANDAS and GAS is controversial because the cause has not been proven. Management is centered on providing antibiotics for GAS infection, and medication or behavioral therapy for neuropsychiatric symptoms. [1] [2] PANDAS is an acronym for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus. It describes the abrupt onset or worsening of symptoms in children who have obsessive-compulsive disorder or a tic disorder (i.e. Tourette syndrome), following a group A streptococcal infection (strep infection). Following a strep infection, children affected by PANDAS typically experience a sudden onset of motor or vocal tics; obsessions; and/or compulsions. These severe symptoms typically last from several weeks to several months. After a gradual improvement, children may not experience any additional problems until they contract another strep infection. [3] [4] [5] Children may also experience the following signs and symptoms during a PANDAS episode: [3] [5] Moodiness and irritability Separation anxiety ADHD symptoms Sleep disturbances Night-time bed wetting and/or day-time urinary frequency Fine motor changes (handwriting) Joint pain Concentration difficulties and loss of academic abilities Developmental regression (i.e. temper tantrums, "baby talk") Although the exact underlying cause of PANDAS has not been proven, studies suggest that it may be an autoimmune disorder. Normally, when a person is exposed to bacteria , the immune system makes proteins called antibodies to fight off the infection. In autoimmune disorders, the body&aposs immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own, healthy body tissue . [6] PANDAS may occur when a  group A streptococcal infection (strep infection) triggers an abnormal   immune response, causing the body to mistakenly attack the tissues of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). [6] However, the role of autoimmunity in PANDAS is controversial. [1] A diagnosis of PANDAS is based on the presence of the following: [4] [6] Obsessive-compulsive disorder or a tic disorder (i.e. Tourette syndrome) Symptoms develop before age 12 Abrupt onset of symptoms and "episodic" course (relapses are separated by periods of time in which children have less severe or no symptoms) Association with group A streptococcal infection (in some cases, the affected person has no obvious symptoms of a strep infection; however, a throat culture and/or blood tests may show evidence of a current or recent infection) Association with other neuropsychiatric symptoms (i.e. separation anxiety, ADHD, developmental regression, etc) There are currently no tests available to confirm a diagnosis of PANDAS. The treatment of PANDAS is symptomatic. Children who are diagnosed with a group A streptococcal infection are typically treated with antibiotics whether or not they develop symptoms of PANDAS. Obsessive-compulsive disorders are usually managed with medications (i.e. SSRI medications such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertaline, or paroxetine) and cognitive behavioral therapy. Tic disorders are often treated with a variety of medications, as well. [4] [5] Some researchers suspect that therapies such as plasmapheresis and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which are often used to treat autoimmune disorders, may be a treatment option for children with PANDAS. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. IVIG can sometimes be used to alter the function or production of abnormal antibodies. Although some studies have demonstrated that both of these therapies are effective for the treatment of severe, strep triggered OCD and tics, a number of the children in these studies experienced severe side-effects. Thus, these treatments are often reserved for severely affected children who do not respond to other therapies. [4] [5] The incidence and prevalence of PANDAS are not known, although it is rare. In one prospective study, only 10 cases were identified among 30,000 throat cultures (1 in 3000) positive for group A streptococci (GAS). Since then, the annual incidence has ranged between 0 per 10,000 cultures to 10 per 30,000 cultures, depending upon the strain of GAS and other factors. Despite its rarity, some researchers suggest that it may account for ≥10% of childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders. [1] The following diseases are related to PANDAS.

-1.71428571429	what are autoimmune blood disorders	Autoimmune hepatitis: Autoimmune hepatitis is liver inflammation that occurs when your body&aposs immune system turns against liver cells. The exact cause of autoimmune hepatitis is unclear, but genetic and environmental factors appear to interact over time in triggering the disease. Untreated autoimmune hepatitis can lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and eventually to liver failure. When diagnosed and treated early, however, autoimmune hepatitis often can be controlled with drugs that suppress the immune system. A liver transplant may be an option when autoimmune hepatitis doesn&apost respond to drug treatments or when liver disease is advanced. Signs and symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis can range from minor to severe and may come on suddenly. Some people have few, if any, recognized problems in the early stages of the disease, whereas others experience signs and symptoms that may include: - Fatigue - Abdominal discomfort - Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) - An enlarged liver - Abnormal blood vessels on the skin (spider angiomas) - Skin rashes - Joint pains - In women, loss of menstruation Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Autoimmune hepatitis occurs when the body&aposs immune system, which ordinarily attacks viruses, bacteria and other pathogens, instead targets the liver. This attack on your liver can lead to chronic inflammation and serious damage to liver cells. Just why the body turns against itself is unclear, but researchers think autoimmune hepatitis could be caused by the interaction of genes controlling immune-system function and exposure to particular viruses or drugs. Doctors have identified two main forms of autoimmune hepatitis: - Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. This is the most common type of the disease. It can occur at any age. About half the people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis. - Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. Although adults can develop type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, it&aposs most common in children and young people. Other autoimmune diseases may also accompany this type of autoimmune hepatitis. Factors that may increase your risk of autoimmune hepatitis include: - Being female. Although both men and women can develop autoimmune hepatitis, the disease is more common in women. - A history of certain infections. Autoimmune hepatitis may develop after you&aposre infected with the measles, herpes simplex or Epstein-Barr virus. The disease is also linked to hepatitis A, B or C infection. - Heredity. Evidence suggests that a predisposition to autoimmune hepatitis may run in families. - Having an autoimmune disease. People who already have an autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hyperthyroidism (Graves&apos disease or Hashimoto&aposs thyroiditis), may be more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis. Tests and procedures used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis include: - Blood tests. Testing a sample of your blood for antibodies can distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from viral hepatitis and other disorders with similar symptoms. Antibody tests also help pinpoint the type of autoimmune hepatitis you have. - Liver biopsy. Doctors perform a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the degree and type of liver damage. During the procedure, a small amount of liver tissue is removed, using a thin needle that&aposs passed into your liver through your skin. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Your doctor may use ultrasound to guide the biopsy. Whatever type of autoimmune hepatitis you have, the goal of treatment is to slow or stop the immune system attack on your liver. This may help slow the progression of the disease. To meet this goal, you&aposll need medications that lower immune-system activity. Treatment with prednisone is generally used initially. A second medication, azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), may be recommended in addition to prednisone. Prednisone, especially when taken long term, can cause a wide range of serious side effects, including diabetes, thinning bones (osteoporosis), broken bones (osteonecrosis), high blood pressure, cataracts, glaucoma and weight gain. Doctors typically prescribe prednisone at a high dose for about the first month of treatment. Then, to reduce the risk of side effects, they gradually reduce the dose over the next several months until reaching the lowest possible dose that controls the disease. Adding azathioprine also helps you avoid prednisone side effects. Most people need to continue taking the prednisone for at least 18 to 24 months, and many remain on it for life. Although you may experience remission a few years after starting treatment, the disease often returns if the drug is discontinued. Liver transplant When medications don&apost halt the progress of the disease, or you develop irreversible scarring (cirrhosis) or liver failure, the remaining option is a liver transplant. During a liver transplant, your diseased liver is removed and replaced by a healthy liver from a donor. Liver transplants most often use livers from deceased organ donors. In some cases, a living-donor liver transplant can be used. During a living-donor liver transplant, you receive only a portion of a healthy liver from a living donor. Both livers begin regenerating new cells almost immediately.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic—or long lasting—disease in which the body&aposs immune system attacks the normal components, or cells, of the liver and causes inflammation and liver damage. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and blocks the normal flow of blood through the liver. Liver failure occurs when the liver stops working properly. What are autoimmune diseases? Autoimmune diseases are disorders in which the body&aposs immune system attacks the body&aposs own cells and organs with proteins called autoantibodies; this process is called autoimmunity. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease of the liver. The body&aposs immune system normally makes large numbers of proteins called antibodies to help the body fight off infections. In some cases, however, the body makes autoantibodies. Certain environmental triggers can lead to autoimmunity. Environmental triggers are things originating outside the body, such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and medications. What causes autoimmune hepatitis? A combination of autoimmunity, environmental triggers, and a genetic predisposition can lead to autoimmune hepatitis. Who is more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis? Autoimmune hepatitis is more common in females.1 The disease can occur at any age and affects all ethnic groups. What are the types of autoimmune hepatitis? Autoimmune hepatitis is classified into several types. Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is the most common form in North America. Type 1 can occur at any age; however, it most often starts in adolescence or young adulthood. About 70 percent of people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis are female.1 People with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis commonly have other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients Crohn&aposs disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the digestive tract Graves&apos disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States Hashimoto&aposs disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis, a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland proliferative glomerulonephritis, or inflammation of the glomeruli, which are tiny clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys primary sclerosing cholangitis, which causes irritation, scarring, and narrowing of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints Sjögren&aposs syndrome, which causes dryness in the mouth and eyes systemic lupus erythematosus, which causes kidney inflammation called lupus nephritis type 1 diabetes, a condition characterized by high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels caused by a total lack of insulin ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the inner lining of the large intestine Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is less common and occurs more often in children than adults.1 People with type 2 can also have any of the above autoimmune disorders. What are the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis? The most common symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are fatigue joint pain nausea loss of appetite pain or discomfort over the liver skin rashes dark yellow urine light-colored stools jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis range from mild to severe. Some people may feel as if they have a mild case of the flu. Others may have no symptoms when a health care provider diagnoses the disease; however, they can develop symptoms later. How is autoimmune hepatitis diagnosed? A health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy. A health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the person&aposs health history, including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver. A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders. Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider&aposs office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A person will need blood tests for autoantibodies to help distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from other liver diseases that have similar symptoms, such as viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, or Wilson disease. Liver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure. During the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. A health care provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, he or she will give sedatives and pain medication. Then, he or she will use a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue, and may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home. A health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The liver sample is sent to a pathology lab where the pathologist—a doctor who specializes in diagnosing disease—looks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patient&aposs health care provider. A health care provider can use liver biopsy to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and determine if cirrhosis is present. People often have cirrhosis at the time they are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. A health care provider can also use liver biopsy to look for changes in the severity of liver damage prior to ending treatment for autoimmune hepatitis. How is autoimmune hepatitis treated? Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Treatment may also include a liver transplant. Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. Long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver. Medications People with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. A health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. In some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. Remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function. Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. Health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. Treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. The treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease. Side effects of prednisone may include weight gain weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia thinning of the hair and skin acne diabetes high blood pressure cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes anxiety and confusion A health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis. Immune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. In most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. When using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone&aposs side effects. Side effects of azathioprine include low white blood cell count nausea vomiting skin rash liver damage pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas Azathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. A low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. Bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. A health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done. A person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. The risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis. A health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. When a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person&aposs condition for a return of symptoms. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years. People who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf). Medications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. People on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer. Liver Transplant In some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. Symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and generalized itching a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop easy bruising a swollen stomach or swollen ankles spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver fluid in the abdomen—also called ascites forgetfulness or confusion Liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. A team of surgeons performs a liver transplant in a hospital. When possible, the patient fasts for 8 hours before the surgery. The patient stays in the hospital about 1 to 2 weeks to be sure the transplanted liver is functioning properly. The health care provider will monitor the patient for bleeding, infections, and signs of liver rejection. The patient will take prescription medications long term to prevent infections and rejection. Liver transplant surgery for autoimmune hepatitis is successful in most cases. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Transplantation. What is a possible complication of autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis? People with autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer. A health care provider will monitor the person with a regular ultrasound examination of the liver. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider&aposs office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the liver&aposs size and the presence of cancerous tumors. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing autoimmune hepatitis. Points to Remember Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic—or long lasting—disease in which the body&aposs immune system attacks the liver and causes inflammation and damage. Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Autoimmune hepatitis is more common in females. The disease can occur at any age and affects all ethnic groups. Autoimmune hepatitis is classified as type 1 or type 2. A health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy. A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. In some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. References [1] Manns MP, Czaja AJ, Gorham JD, et al.

0.8	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Risk factors): Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse
-0.3	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	How to diagnose Bipolar disorder?: To diagnose bipolar disorder, the health care provider may do some or all of the following: - Ask whether other family members have bipolar disorder - Ask about your recent mood swings and for how long you have had them - Perform a thorough exam and order lab tests to look for other illnesses that may be causing symptoms that resemble bipolar disorder - Talk to family members about your symptoms and overall health - Ask about any health problems you have and any medications you take - Watch your behavior and mood
1.9	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You&aposve had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You&aposve had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you&aposve never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You&aposve had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing&aposs disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it&aposs diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It&aposs often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don&apost recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don&apost get the treatment they need. And if you&aposre like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn&apost get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you&aposll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you&aposll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you&aposre behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you&aposre having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You&aposll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it&aposs usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn&apost work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don&apost make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you&aposre taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what&aposs going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don&apost get better with medications, can&apost take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven&apost responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There&aposs less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child&aposs developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. You&aposll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who&aposs treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you&aposre taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. There isn&apost much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn&apost clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don&apost stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren&apost regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it&aposs natural doesn&apost mean it&aposs safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications.

Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.
2.0	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Causes): The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder.
-0.7	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Lifestyle and home remedies): You&aposll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who&aposs treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you&aposre taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted.
-0.9	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Complications): Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity
-0.4	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Diagnosis): To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended.
-0.6	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Treatment): Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you&aposll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you&aposll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you&aposre behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you&aposre having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You&aposll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it&aposs usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn&apost work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don&apost make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you&aposre taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what&aposs going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don&apost get better with medications, can&apost take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven&apost responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There&aposs less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child&aposs developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success.
-0.8	what are known causes of bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Alternative medicine): There isn&apost much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn&apost clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don&apost stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren&apost regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it&aposs natural doesn&apost mean it&aposs safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications.
0.909090909091	what are pancreatic enzymes?	Pancreatic cysts: Pancreatic cysts are saclike pockets of fluid on or in your pancreas, a large organ behind the stomach that produces hormones and enzymes that help digest food. Most pancreatic cysts aren&apost cancerous, and many don&apost cause symptoms. They&aposre typically found during imaging testing for another problem. Some are actually noncancerous (benign) pockets of fluids lined with scar or inflammatory tissue, not the type of cells found in true cysts (pseudocysts). But some pancreatic cysts can be or can become cancerous. Your doctor might take a sample of the pancreatic cyst fluid to determine if cancer cells are present. Or your doctor might recommend monitoring a cyst over time for changes that indicate cancer. You may not have symptoms from pancreatic cysts, which are often found when imaging tests of the abdomen are done for another reason. When signs or symptoms of pancreatic cysts do occur, they typically include: - Persistent abdominal pain, which may radiate to your back - A mass you can feel in your upper abdomen - Nausea and vomiting When to see a doctor Rarely, cysts can become infected. See a doctor if you have a fever and persistent abdominal pain. A ruptured pseudocyst can be a medical emergency, but fortunately is rare. Fluid released by the pseudocyst can damage nearby blood vessels and cause massive bleeding. A ruptured pseudocyst can also cause infection of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). Seek emergency medical treatment if you have signs or symptoms of internal bleeding and shock, including: - Fainting - Severe abdominal pain - Decreased consciousness - Weak and rapid heartbeat - Vomiting of blood The cause of most pancreatic cysts is unknown. Some cysts are associated with rare illnesses including von Hippel-Lindau disease, a genetic disorder that can affect the pancreas and other organs. Pseudocysts often follow a bout of a painful condition in which digestive enzymes become prematurely active and irritate the pancreas (pancreatitis). Pseudocysts can also result from injury to the abdomen, such as from a car accident. Heavy alcohol use and gallstones are risk factors for pancreatitis, and pancreatitis is a risk factor for pseudocysts. Abdominal injury is also a risk factor for pseudocysts. Pancreatic cysts are diagnosed more often than in the past because improved imaging technology finds them more readily. Many pancreatic cysts are found during abdominal scans for other problems. The main challenge in diagnosis is to determine whether the cyst might become cancerous. These procedures are often used to help with diagnosis and treatment planning: - Medical history. Previous abdominal injury or pancreatitis might indicate a pseudocyst. - CT scan. This imaging test can provide detailed information about the size and structure of a pancreatic cyst. - MRI scan. This imaging test can highlight subtle details of a pancreatic cyst, including whether it has any components that suggest a higher risk of cancer. - Endoscopic ultrasound. This test, like MRI, can provide a detailed image of the cyst. Also, fluid can be collected from the cyst for analysis in a laboratory for possible signs of cancer. The characteristics and location of the pancreatic cyst, with your age and sex, can help doctors pinpoint the type of cyst you have: - Serous cystadenoma can become large enough to displace nearby organs, causing abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness. Serous cystadenomas occur most frequently in women older than 60 and only rarely become cancerous. - Mucinous cystadenoma is usually situated in the body or tail of the pancreas and occurs most often in middle-aged women. Mucinous cystadenoma is precancerous, which means it might become cancer if left untreated. Larger cysts might already be cancerous when found. - Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a growth in the main pancreatic duct or one of its side branches. IPMN may be precancerous or cancerous. It occurs most often in men and women older than 50. Depending on its location and other factors, IPMN may require surgical removal. - Papillary cystic tumor is usually situated in the body or tail of the pancreas and occurs most often in women younger than 35. Also known as papillary cystic neoplasm, it&aposs rare and usually cancerous. - Cystic islet cell tumor is mostly solid but can have cystlike components. Cystic islet cell tumors are rare. They can be confused with other pancreatic cysts and may be precancerous or cancerous. Watchful waiting or treatment depends on the type of cyst you have, its size, its characteristics and whether it&aposs causing symptoms. Watchful waiting A benign pseudocyst, even a large one, can be left alone as long as it isn&apost bothering you. Serous cystadenoma rarely becomes cancerous, so it also can be left alone unless it causes symptoms or grows. But all pancreatic cysts should be monitored. Drainage A pseudocyst that is causing bothersome symptoms or growing larger can be drained. A small flexible tube (endoscope) is passed through your mouth to your stomach and small intestine. The endoscope is equipped with an ultrasound probe (endoscopic ultrasound) and a needle to drain the cyst. Sometimes drainage through the skin is necessary. Surgery Surgery might be needed to remove an enlarged pseudocyst or a serous cystadenoma that&aposs causing pain or other symptoms. Other types of pancreatic cysts generally require surgical removal because of the risk of cancer. A pseudocyst may recur if you have ongoing pancreatitis.
-1.63636363636	what are pancreatic enzymes?	What are the treatments for Pancreatic abscess?: It may be possible to drain the abscess through the skin (percutaneous). Abscess drainage can be done through an endoscope using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in some cases. Surgery to drain the abscess and remove dead tissue is often needed.
1.0	what are pancreatic enzymes?	Pancreatic cancer: Pancreatic cancer is cancer that starts in the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach. It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels. There are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell the cancer develops in. Examples include: - Adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer - Other more rare types include glucagonoma, insulinoma, islet cell tumor, VIPoma The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in persons who: - Are obese - Have a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables - Have diabetes - Have long-term exposure to certain chemicals - Have long-term inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) - Smoke Pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in women than in men. The risk increases with age. Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer. A tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: - Diarrhea - Dark urine and clay-colored stools - Fatigue and weakness - Sudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes) - Jaundice (a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin - Loss of appetite and weight loss - Nausea and vomiting - Pain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen The doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the exam, the doctor may feel a lump (mass) in your abdomen. Blood tests that may be ordered include: - Complete blood count (CBC) - Liver function tests - Serum bilirubin Imaging tests that may be ordered include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - Endoscopic ultrasound - MRI of the abdomen Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (and what type) is made by a pancreatic biopsy. If tests confirm you have pancreatic cancer, more tests will be done to see how far the cancer has spread within and outside the pancreas. This is called staging. Staging helps guide treatment and gives you an idea of what to expect. Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach. When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended. When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used. With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Some people with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed are cured. But in most people, the tumor has spread and cannot be completely removed at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy and radiation are often given after surgery to increase the cure rate (this is called adjuvant therapy). For pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed completely with surgery or cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, a cure is not possible. In this case, chemotherapy is given to improve and extend one&aposs life. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have: - Abdominal pain that does not go away - Back pain - Loss of appetite - Unexplained fatigue or weight loss - Other symptoms of this disorder Preventive measures include: - If you smoke, now is the time to quit. - Keep a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. - Exercise regularly to stay at a healthy weight.

0.636363636364	what are pancreatic enzymes?	Pancreatic cancer: Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas - an organ in your abdomen that lies horizontally behind the lower part of your stomach. Your pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that help manage your blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer typically spreads rapidly to nearby organs. It is seldom detected in its early stages. But for people with pancreatic cysts or a family history of pancreatic cancer, some screening steps might help detect a problem early. One sign of pancreatic cancer is diabetes, especially when it occurs with weight loss, jaundice or pain in the upper abdomen that spreads to the back. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of these. Pancreatic cancer care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer often don&apost occur until the disease is advanced. They may include: - Pain in the upper abdomen that radiates to your back - Loss of appetite or unintended weight loss - Depression - New-onset diabetes - Blood clots - Fatigue - Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience unexplained weight loss or if you have persistent fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, or other signs and symptoms that bother you. Many conditions can cause these symptoms, so your doctor may check for these conditions as well as for pancreatic cancer. It&aposs not clear what causes pancreatic cancer in most cases. Doctors have identified factors, such as smoking, that increase your risk of developing the disease. Understanding your pancreas Your pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side. It releases (secretes) hormones, including insulin, to help your body process sugar in the foods you eat. And it produces digestive juices to help your body digest food. How pancreatic cancer forms Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas develop mutations in their DNA. These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after normal cells would die. These accumulating cells can form a tumor. Untreated pancreatic cancer spreads to nearby organs and blood vessels. Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas. This type of cancer is called pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer. Rarely, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas. These types of cancer are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine cancer and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Factors that may increase your risk of pancreatic cancer include: - Chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) - Diabetes - Family history of genetic syndromes that can increase cancer risk, including a BRCA2 gene mutation, Lynch syndrome and familial atypical mole-malignant melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome - Family history of pancreatic cancer - Smoking - Obesity - Older age, as most people are diagnosed after age 65 A large study demonstrated that the combination of smoking, long-standing diabetes and a poor diet increases the risk of pancreatic cancer beyond the risk of any one of these factors alone. As pancreatic cancer progresses, it can cause complications such as: - Weight loss. A number of factors may cause weight loss in people with pancreatic cancer. The cancer itself may cause weight loss. Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer treatments or a tumor pressing on your stomach may make it difficult to eat. Or your body may have difficulty processing nutrients from food because your pancreas isn&apost making enough digestive juices. Your doctor may recommend pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid in digestion. Try to maintain your weight by adding extra calories where you can and making mealtime as pleasant and relaxed as possible. - Jaundice. Pancreatic cancer that blocks the liver&aposs bile duct can cause jaundice. Signs include yellow skin and eyes, dark-colored urine, and pale-colored stools. Jaundice usually occurs without abdominal pain. Your doctor may recommend that a plastic or metal tube (stent) be placed inside the bile duct to hold it open. This is done with the help of a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). During ERCP an endoscope is passed down your throat, through your stomach and into the upper part of your small intestine. A dye is then injected into the pancreatic and bile ducts through a small hollow tube (catheter) that&aposs passed through the endoscope. Finally, images are taken of the ducts. - Pain. A growing tumor may press on nerves in your abdomen, causing pain that can become severe. Pain medications can help you feel more comfortable. Radiation therapy might help stop tumor growth temporarily to give you some relief. In severe cases, your doctor might recommend a procedure to inject alcohol into the nerves that control pain in your abdomen (celiac plexus block). This procedure stops the nerves from sending pain signals to your brain. - Bowel obstruction. Pancreatic cancer that grows into or presses on the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) can block the flow of digested food from your stomach into your intestines. Your doctor may recommend a tube (stent) be placed in your small intestine to hold it open. Or surgery may be necessary to attach your stomach to a lower point in your intestines that isn&apost blocked by cancer. If your doctor suspects pancreatic cancer, he or she may have you undergo one or more of the following tests: - Imaging tests that create pictures of your internal organs. These tests help your doctors visualize your internal organs, including the pancreas. Techniques used to diagnose pancreatic cancer include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, sometimes, positron emission tomography (PET) scans. - Using a scope to create ultrasound pictures of your pancreas. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) uses an ultrasound device to make images of your pancreas from inside your abdomen. The device is passed through a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your esophagus and into your stomach in order to obtain the images. - Removing a tissue sample for testing (biopsy). A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope. Your doctor may obtain a sample of tissue from the pancreas by inserting a needle through your skin and into your pancreas (fine-needle aspiration). Or he or she may remove a sample during EUS, guiding special tools into the pancreas. - Blood test. Your doctor may test your blood for specific proteins (tumor markers) shed by pancreatic cancer cells. One tumor marker test used in pancreatic cancer is called CA19-9. But the test isn&apost always reliable, and it isn&apost clear how best to use the CA19-9 test results. Some doctors measure your levels before, during and after treatment. If your doctor confirms a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, he or she tries to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. Using information from staging tests, your doctor assigns your pancreatic cancer a stage, which helps determine what treatments are most likely to benefit to you. The stages of pancreatic cancer are indicated by Roman numerals ranging from 0 to IV. The lowest stages indicate that the cancer is confined to the pancreas. By stage IV, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The cancer staging system continues to evolve and is becoming more complex as doctors improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. Your doctor uses your cancer stage to select the treatments that are right for you. Don&apost hesitate to ask your doctor about his or her experience with diagnosing pancreatic cancer. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion. Treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the stage and location of the cancer as well as on your overall health and personal preferences. For most people, the first goal of pancreatic cancer treatment is to eliminate the cancer, when possible. When that isn&apost an option, the focus may be on improving your quality of life and preventing the cancer from growing or causing more harm. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of these. When pancreatic cancer is advanced and these treatments aren&apost likely to offer a benefit, your doctor will offer symptom relief (palliative care) that makes you as comfortable as possible. Surgery Operations used in people with pancreatic cancer include: - Surgery for tumors in the pancreatic head. If your cancer is located in the head of the pancreas, you may consider an operation called a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy). The Whipple procedure is technically difficult operation to remove the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), the gallbladder and part of the bile duct. In some situations, part of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes may be removed as well. Your surgeon reconnects the remaining parts of your pancreas, stomach and intestines to allow you to digest food. - Surgery for tumors in the pancreatic body and tail. Surgery to remove the left side (body and tail) of the pancreas is called distal pancreatectomy. Your surgeon may also remove your spleen. - Surgery to remove the entire pancreas. In some people, the entire pancreas may need to be removed. This is called total pancreatectomy. You can live relatively normally without a pancreas but do need lifelong insulin and enzyme replacement. - Surgery for tumors affecting nearby blood vessels. Many people with advanced pancreatic cancer are not considered eligible for the Whipple procedure or other pancreatic surgeries if their tumors involve nearby blood vessels. At a very few medical centers in the United States, highly specialized and experienced surgeons will safely perform these operations with removal and reconstruction of parts of blood vessels in select patients. Each of these surgeries carries the risk of bleeding and infection. After surgery some people experience nausea and vomiting if the stomach has difficulty emptying (delayed gastric emptying). Expect a long recovery after any of these procedures. You&aposll spend several days in the hospital and then recover for several weeks at home. Extensive research shows pancreatic cancer surgery tends to cause fewer complications when done by highly experienced surgeons at centers that do many of these operations. Don&apost hesitate to ask about your surgeon&aposs and hospital&aposs experience with pancreatic cancer surgery. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to help kill cancer cells. These drugs can be injected into a vein or taken orally. You may receive one chemotherapy drug or a combination of them. Chemotherapy can also be combined with radiation therapy (chemoradiation). Chemoradiation is typically used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, but only to nearby organs and not to distant regions of the body. At specialized medical centers, this combination may be used before surgery to help shrink the tumor. Sometimes it is used after surgery to reduce the risk that pancreatic cancer may recur. In people with advanced pancreatic cancer, chemotherapy is often used to control cancer growth and prolong survival. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as those made from X-rays and protons, to destroy cancer cells. You may receive radiation treatments before or after cancer surgery, often in combination with chemotherapy. Or your doctor may recommend a combination of radiation and chemotherapy treatments when your cancer can&apost be treated surgically. Radiation therapy usually comes from a machine that moves around you, directing radiation to specific points on your body (external beam radiation). In specialized medical centers, radiation therapy may be delivered during surgery (intraoperative radiation). Radiation therapy traditionally uses X-rays to treat cancer. Some medical centers offer proton beam radiation therapy, which may be a treatment option for some people with advanced pancreatic cancer. Clinical trials Clinical trials are studies to test new treatments, such as systemic therapy, and new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy. If the treatment being studied proves to be safer and more effective than are current treatments, it can become the new standard of care. Clinical trials for pancreatic cancer might give you a chance to try new targeted therapy, chemotherapy drugs, immunotherapy treatments or vaccines. Clinical trials can&apost guarantee a cure, and they might have serious or unexpected side effects. On the other hand, cancer clinical trials are closely monitored to ensure they&aposre conducted as safely as possible. And they offer access to treatments that wouldn&apost otherwise be available to you. Talk to your doctor about what clinical trials might be appropriate for you. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When palliative care is used along with other appropriate treatments - even soon after the diagnosis - people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by teams of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. These teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. Palliative care is not the same as hospice care or end-of-life care. Some integrative and alternative medicine approaches may help with signs and symptoms you experience due to your cancer or cancer treatments. Treatments to help you cope with distress People with cancer frequently experience distress. Some research suggests distress is more common in people with pancreatic cancer than it is in people with other types of cancer. If you&aposre distressed, you may have difficulty sleeping and find yourself constantly thinking about your cancer. You may feel angry or sad. Discuss your feelings with your doctor. Specialists can help you sort through your feelings and help you devise strategies for coping. In some cases, medications may help.

0.545454545455	what are pancreatic enzymes?	Pancreatic Cancer: The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine. There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas. Exocrine pancreas cells make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Neuroendocrine pancreas cells (such as islet cells) make several hormones, including insulin and glucagon, that help control sugar levels in the blood. Most pancreatic cancers form in exocrine cells. These tumors do not secrete hormones and do not cause signs or symptoms. This makes it hard to diagnose this type of pancreatic cancer early. For most patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. Some types of malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, such as islet cell tumors, have a better prognosis than pancreatic exocrine cancers. - Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. - Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. - Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. - Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. - Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. - Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. - Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. - Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. - Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Chemoradiation therapy - Targeted therapy - There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed - There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Chemoradiation therapy - Targeted therapy - There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed Stages I and II Pancreatic Cancer Treatment of stage I and stage II pancreatic cancer may include the following: - Surgery. - Surgery followed by chemotherapy. - Surgery followed by chemoradiation. - A clinical trial of combination chemotherapy. - A clinical trial of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, with or without chemoradiation. - A clinical trial of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery.

-1.72727272727	what are pancreatic enzymes?	Pancreatic abscess: A pancreatic abscess is an area filled with pus within the pancreas. Pancreatic abscesses develop in people who have pancreatic pseudocysts that become infected. Symptoms include: - Abdominal mass - Abdominal pain - Chills - Fever - Inability to eat - Nausea and vomiting Most people with pancreatic abscesses have had pancreatitis. However, the complication often takes 7 or more days to develop. Signs of an abscess can be seen on: - CT scan of the abdomen - MRI of the abdomen - Ultrasound of the abdomen It may be possible to drain the abscess through the skin (percutaneous). Abscess drainage can be done through an endoscope using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in some cases. Surgery to drain the abscess and remove dead tissue is often needed. How well a person does depends on how severe the infection is. The death rate from undrained pancreatic abscesses is very high. Complications may include: - Multiple abscesses - Sepsis Call your health care provider if you have abdominal pain with fever or other signs of a pancreatic abscess, especially if you have recently had a pancreatic pseudocyst or pancreatitis. Draining a pancreatic pseudocyst may help prevent some cases of pancreatic abscess. However, in many cases the disorder is not preventable. Updated by: Subodh K.

0.727272727273	what are pancreatic enzymes?	Pancreatic pseudocyst: A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled sac in the abdomen. It may also contain tissue from the pancreas, enzymes, and blood. The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of sudden, severe pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is sudden swelling of the pancreas. There are many causes of this problem. This problem may sometimes occur: - In someone with chronic swelling of the pancreas - After trauma to the belly, more often in children The cyst happens when the ducts (tubes) in the pancreas are damaged and fluid with enzymes cannot drain. Symptoms can occur within days to months after an attack of pancreatitis, and include: - Bloating of the abdomen - Constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen, which may also be felt in the back - Difficulty eating and digesting food The health care provider may feel your abdomen for a pseudocyst. It will feel like a lump in the middle or left upper abdomen. Tests that may help diagnose pancreatic pseudocyst include: - Abdominal CT scan - Abdominal MRI - Abdominal ultrasound - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) Treatment depends on the size of the pseudocyst and whether it is causing symptoms. Many pseudocysts go away on their own. Those that remain for more than 6 weeks and are larger than 5 cm in diameter often need treatment. Possible treatments include: - Drainage through the skin using a needle, most often guided by a CT scan - Endoscopic-assisted drainage using an endoscope (a tube containing a camera and a light that is passed down into the stomach) - Surgical drainage of the pseudocyst, which involves making a connection between the cyst and the stomach or small intestine. This may be done using a laparoscope. The outcome is generally good with treatment. It is important to make sure that it is not a pancreatic cancer that starts in a cyst, which has a worse outcome. Complications may include: - A pancreatic abscess can develop if the pseudocyst becomes infected. - The pseudocyst can break open (rupture), which can be a serious complication because shock and excess bleeding (hemorrhage) may develop. - The pseudocyst may press down on (compress) nearby organs. Rupture of the pseudocyst is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of bleeding or shock, such as: - Fainting - Fever and chills - Rapid heartbeat - Severe abdominal pain The way to prevent pancreatic pseudocysts is by preventing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is caused by gallstones, it is often necessary to remove the gallbladder with surgery (cholecystectomy). When pancreatitis occurs due to alcohol abuse, you must stop drinking alcohol to prevent future attacks. When pancreatitis occurs due to high blood triglycerides, this condition should be treated.

Pancreatic Islet Transplantation (What is pancreatic islet transplantation?): The two types of pancreatic islet transplantation areallo-transplantation auto-transplantationallo-transplantationauto-transplantationPancreatic islet allo-transplantation is a procedure in which islets from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor are purified, processed, and transferred into another person. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is currently labeled an experimental procedure until the transplantation technology is considered successful enough to be labeled therapeutic. For more information, see the section "What are the obstacles to pancreatic islet allo-transplantation?"Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation"What are the obstacles to pancreatic islet allo-transplantation?"For each pancreatic islet allo-transplant infusion, researchers use specialized enzymes to remove islets from the pancreas of a single, deceased donor. The islets are purified and counted in a lab. Transplant patients typically receive two infusions with an average of 400,000 to 500,000 islets per infusion. Once implanted, the beta cells in these islets begin to make and release insulin.Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is performed in certain patients with type 1 diabetes whose blood glucose levels are difficult to control. The goals of the transplant are to help these patients achieve normal blood glucose levels with or without daily injections of insulin and to reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness—a dangerous condition in which a person with diabetes cannot feel the symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose. When a person feels the symptoms of hypoglycemia, steps can be taken to bring blood glucose levels back to normal.Pancreatic islet allo-transplants are only performed at hospitals that have received permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical research on islet transplantation. The transplants are often performed by a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. The radiologist uses x rays and ultrasound to guide the placement of a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a small incision in the upper abdomen—the area between the chest and hips—and into the portal vein of the liver. The portal vein is the major vein that supplies blood to the liver. The islets are then infused, or pushed, slowly into the liver through the catheter. Usually, the patient receives a local anesthetic and a sedative. In some cases, a surgeon performs the transplant using general anesthesia.Patients often need two or more transplants to get enough functioning islets to stop or reduce their need for insulin injections.Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation (above).

The immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with a condition called insulin resistance, in which the body has trouble using insulin effectively. Over time, insulin production declines as well, so many people with type 2 diabetes eventually need to take insulin.

Within hours, the islets are infused through a catheter into the patient&aposs liver. The goal is to give the body enough healthy islets to make insulin. What happens after pancreatic islet transplantation? Pancreatic islets begin to release insulin soon after transplantation. However, full islet function and new blood vessel growth from the new islets take time. Transplant recipients usually take insulin injections until the islets are fully functional. They may also receive various medications before and after transplantation to promote successful implantation and long-term functioning of the islets. However, the autoimmune response that destroyed transplant recipients&apos own islets in the first place can happen again and attack the transplanted islets. Although the liver has been the traditional site for infusing the donor islets, researchers are investigating alternative sites, such as muscle tissue or another organ. What are the benefits and risks of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation? The benefits of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation include improved blood glucose control, reducing or eliminating the need for insulin injections to control diabetes, and preventing hypoglycemia. An alternative to islet transplantation is whole organ pancreas transplantation that is performed most often with kidney transplantation. The advantages of whole organ pancreas transplantation are less dependence on insulin and longer duration of organ function. The main disadvantage is that a whole organ transplant is a major surgery that involves a greater risk of complications and even death. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation can also help reverse hypoglycemia unawareness. Research has shown that even partial islet function after a transplant can eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness. Improved blood glucose control from a successful allo-transplant may also slow or prevent the progression of diabetes problems, such as heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve or eye damage. Research to evaluate this possibility is ongoing. The risks of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation include the risks associated with the transplant procedure—particularly bleeding and blood clots. The transplanted islets may not function well or may stop functioning entirely. Other risks are the side effects from the immunosuppressive medications that transplant recipients must take to stop the immune system from rejecting the transplanted islets. When a patient has received a kidney transplant and is already taking immunosuppressive medications, the only additional risks are the islet infusion and the side effects from the immunosuppressive medications given at the time of allo-transplantation. Immunosuppressive medications are not needed in the case of an auto-transplant because the infused cells come from the patient&aposs own body. Read more in the section "What is the role of immunosuppressive medications?" Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry Data In its 2010 annual report,1 the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry presented data on 571 patients who received pancreatic islet allo-transplants between 1999 and 2009. Although most procedures were pancreatic islet allo-transplants alone, 90 procedures were done in conjunction with a kidney transplant. The majority of the islet transplant patients received one or two infusions of islets; at the end of the decade, the average number of islets received per infusion was 463,000. According to the report, about 60 percent of transplant recipients achieved insulin independence—defined as being able to stop insulin injections for at least 14 days—during the year following transplantation. By the end of the second year, 50 percent of recipients were able to stop taking insulin for at least 14 days. However, long-term insulin independence is difficult to maintain, and eventually most recipients needed to start taking insulin again. The report identified factors linked to better outcomes for recipients, including age—35 years or older lower pre-transplant triglyceride, or blood fat, levels lower pre-transplant insulin use The report noted that even partial function of the transplanted islets can improve blood glucose control and reduce the amount of insulin needed after loss of insulin independence. 1Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry seventh annual report.

What is the role of immunosuppressive medications? Immunosuppressive medications are needed to prevent rejection—a common problem with any transplant. Scientists have made many advances in islet transplantation in recent years. In 2000, islet transplantation researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, reported their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine. Their transplant protocol, known as the Edmonton protocol, has since been adapted by transplant centers around the world and continues to be refined. The Edmonton protocol introduced the use of a new combination of immunosuppressive medications, also called anti-rejection medications, including daclizumab (Zenapax), sirolimus (Rapamune), and tacrolimus (Prograf). Researchers continue to develop and study modifications to the Edmonton protocol, including improved medication regimens that promote successful transplants. Medication regimens vary from one transplant center to another. Examples of other immunosuppressive medications used in islet transplantation include antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin), alemtuzumab (Campath), basiliximab (Simulect), belatacept (Nulojix), etanercept (Enbrel), everolimus (Zortress), and mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept, Myfortic). Researchers are also evaluating nonimmunosuppresive medications, such as exenatide (Byetta) and sitagliptin (Januvia). Immunosuppressive medications have significant side effects, and their long-term effects are still not fully known. Immediate side effects may include mouth sores and gastrointestinal problems, such as upset stomach and diarrhea. Patients may also have increased blood cholesterol, or blood fat, levels high blood pressure anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the body&aposs cells from getting enough oxygen fatigue decreased white blood cell counts decreased kidney function increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections Taking immunosuppressive medications also increases the risk of developing certain tumors and cancers. Scientists are seeking ways to achieve immune tolerance of the transplanted islets, in which the patient&aposs immune system no longer recognizes the islets as foreign. Immune tolerance would allow patients to maintain transplanted islets without long-term use of immunosuppressive medications. For example, one approach is to transplant islets encapsulated with a special coating, which may help to prevent rejection. What are the obstacles to pancreatic islet allo-transplantation? The shortage of islets from donors is a significant obstacle to widespread use of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, in 2011 there were about 8,000 deceased organ donors available in the United States.2 However, only 1,562 pancreases were recovered from donors in 2011.2 Also, many donated pancreases are not suitable for extracting islets for transplants because they do not meet the selection criteria, and islets are often damaged or destroyed during processing. Therefore, only a small number of islet transplants can be performed each year. Researchers are pursuing various approaches to solve this shortage of islets, such as transplanting islets from a single, donated pancreas, using only a portion of the pancreas from a living donor, or using islets from pigs. Researchers have transplanted pig islets into other animals, including monkeys, by encapsulating the islets with a special coating or by using medications to prevent rejection. Another approach is creating islets from other types of cells, such as stem cells. New technologies could then be employed to grow islets in the lab. Financial barriers also prevent the widespread use of islet allo-transplantation. Until the transplantation technology is considered successful enough to be labeled therapeutic rather than experimental, the costs of islet allo-transplants must be covered by research funds. Health insurance companies and Medicare generally do not cover experimental procedures. Federal law also does not allow health care providers or hospitals to charge patients or health insurance companies for research procedures. Some patient advocates and islet researchers feel that islet allo-transplantation is close to having a therapeutic label. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) currently supports studies that are working toward obtaining FDA licensure to reclassify islet allo-transplantation as therapeutic. In other countries, such as Canada and Scandinavia, islet allo-transplantation is no longer considered experimental and is an accepted therapy in certain patients. 2National data. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network website. https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/. Accessed July 23, 2013. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition A person who receives a pancreatic islet transplant should follow a meal plan worked out with a health care provider and dietitian. Immunosuppressive medications taken after the transplant can cause changes in a person&aposs body, such as weight gain. A healthy diet after the transplant is important to control weight gain, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose levels. Points to Remember Pancreatic islets, also called islets of Langerhans, are tiny clusters of cells scattered throughout the pancreas. Pancreatic islets contain several types of cells, including beta cells, that produce the hormone insulin. Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and use it for energy. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is a procedure in which islets from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor are purified, processed, and transferred into another person. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is performed in certain patients with type 1 diabetes whose blood glucose levels are difficult to control. The goals of the transplant are to help these patients achieve normal blood glucose levels with or without daily injections of insulin and to reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness. Pancreatic islet auto-transplantation is performed following total pancreatectomy in patients with severe and chronic pancreatitis that cannot be managed by other treatments. This procedure is not considered experimental. Patients with type 1 diabetes cannot receive pancreatic islet auto-transplantation. The shortage of islets from donors is a significant obstacle to widespread use of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation. Financial barriers also prevent the widespread use of islet allo-transplantation. Until the transplantation technology is considered successful enough to be labeled therapeutic rather than experimental, the costs of islet allo-transplants must be covered by research funds. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions. What are clinical trials, and are they right for you? Clinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances.

It can be difficult to tell based on a person&aposs weight whether someone has bulimia. This is because binging and purging is most often done in private. However, family or friends may see empty food wrappers in unexpected places or vomit in the home. Over time, some symptoms of bulimia may include:5 Girls or women with bulimia may also have behavior changes such as: People with bulimia often have other mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.6
2.0	what are some common symptoms of bulimia	What are the symptoms of Bulimia?: With bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include: - Forcing oneself to vomit - Excessive exercise - Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills) Purging often brings a sense of relief. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person&aposs weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include: - Spending a lot of time exercising - Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away - Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals - Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics
1.9	what are some common symptoms of bulimia	Bulimia nervosa (Symptoms): Bulimia signs and symptoms may include: - Being preoccupied with your body shape and weight - Living in fear of gaining weight - Feeling that you can&apost control your eating behavior - Eating until the point of discomfort or pain - Eating much more food in a binge episode than in a normal meal or snack - Forcing yourself to vomit or exercise too much to keep from gaining weight after bingeing - Misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating - Restricting calories or avoiding certain foods between binges - Using dietary supplements or herbal products excessively for weight loss If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. If left untreated, bulimia can severely impact your health. Talk to your primary care provider or a mental health provider about your bulimia symptoms and feelings. If you&aposre reluctant to seek treatment, confide in someone about what you&aposre going through, whether it&aposs a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. He or she can help you take the first steps to get successful bulimia treatment. If you think a loved one may have symptoms of bulimia, have an open and honest discussion about your concerns. You can&apost force someone to seek professional care, but you can offer encouragement and support. You can also help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider, make an appointment, and even offer to go along. Because most people with bulimia are normal weight or slightly overweight, it may not be apparent to others that something is wrong. Red flags that family and friends may notice include: - Constantly worrying or complaining about being fat - Having a distorted, excessively negative body image - Repeatedly eating unusually large quantities of food in one sitting, especially foods the person would normally avoid - Not wanting to eat in public or in front of others - Going to the bathroom right after eating or during meals - Exercising too much - Having sores, scars or calluses on the knuckles or hands - Having damaged teeth and gums
-0.6	what are some common symptoms of bulimia	Bulimia nervosa (Treatment): When you have bulimia, you may need several types of treatment, although combining psychotherapy with antidepressants may be the most effective for overcoming the disorder. Treatment generally involves a team approach that includes you, your family, your primary care doctor or other health care provider, as well as a mental health provider and a dietitian experienced in treating eating disorders. You may have a case manager to coordinate your care. Here&aposs a look at bulimia treatment options and considerations. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, involves discussing your bulimia and related issues with a mental health provider. Evidence indicates that these types of psychotherapy help improve symptoms of bulimia: - Cognitive behavioral therapy to help you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones - Family-based therapy to help parents intervene to stop their teenager&aposs unhealthy eating behaviors, then to help the teen regain control over his or her own eating, and lastly to help the family deal with problems that bulimia can have on the teen&aposs development and the family - Interpersonal psychotherapy, which addresses difficulties in your close relationships, helping to improve your communication and problem-solving skills Ask your mental health provider which psychotherapy he or she will use and what evidence exists that shows it&aposs beneficial in treating bulimia. Medications Antidepressants may help reduce the symptoms of bulimia when used along with psychotherapy. The only antidepressant specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat bulimia is fluoxetine (Prozac), a type of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which may help even if you&aposre not depressed. Nutrition education and healthy weight Dietitians and other health care providers can design an eating plan to help you achieve a healthy weight, normal eating habits and good nutrition. If you have bulimia, you may benefit from a medically supervised weight-loss program. Hospitalization Bulimia can usually be treated outside of the hospital. But if you have a severe form and serious health complications, you may need treatment in a hospital. Some eating disorder programs may offer day treatment rather than inpatient hospitalization. Treatment challenges in bulimia Although most people with bulimia do recover, some find that symptoms don&apost go away entirely. Periods of bingeing and purging may come and go through the years, depending on your life circumstances, such as recurrence during times of high stress. If you find yourself back in the binge-purge cycle, "booster" sessions with your health care providers may help you weather the crisis before your eating disorder spirals out of control again. Learning positive ways to cope, creating healthy relationships and managing stress can help prevent a relapse.
1.7	what are some common symptoms of bulimia	Bulimia nervosa: Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia may secretly binge - eating large amounts of food - and then purge, trying to get rid of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. For example, someone with bulimia may force vomiting or engage in excessive exercise. Sometimes people purge after eating only a small snack or a normal-size meal. Bulimia can be categorized in two ways: - Purging bulimia. You regularly self-induce vomiting or misuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas after bingeing. - Nonpurging bulimia. You use other methods to rid yourself of calories and prevent weight gain, such as fasting, strict dieting or excessive exercise. However, these behaviors often overlap, and the attempt to rid yourself of extra calories is usually referred to as purging, no matter what the method. If you have bulimia, you&aposre probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for self-perceived flaws. Because it&aposs related to self-image - and not just about food - bulimia can be hard to overcome. But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, adopt healthier eating patterns and reverse serious complications. Bulimia care at Mayo Clinic Bulimia signs and symptoms may include: - Being preoccupied with your body shape and weight - Living in fear of gaining weight - Feeling that you can&apost control your eating behavior - Eating until the point of discomfort or pain - Eating much more food in a binge episode than in a normal meal or snack - Forcing yourself to vomit or exercise too much to keep from gaining weight after bingeing - Misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating - Restricting calories or avoiding certain foods between binges - Using dietary supplements or herbal products excessively for weight loss If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible.

There are many factors that could play a role in the development of eating disorders, including biology, emotional health, societal expectations and other issues. Factors that increase your risk of bulimia may include: - Being female. Girls and women are more likely to have bulimia than boys and men are. - Age. Bulimia often begins in the late teens or early adulthood. - Biology. People with first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children) with an eating disorder may be more likely to develop an eating disorder, suggesting a possible genetic link. It&aposs also possible that a deficiency in the brain chemical serotonin may play a role. And, being overweight as a child or teen may increase the risk. - Psychological and emotional issues. Psychological and emotional problems, such as anxiety disorder or low self-esteem, can contribute to eating disorders. Triggers for bingeing may include stress, poor body self-image, food, restrictive dieting or boredom. In some cases, traumatic events and environmental stress may be contributing factors. - Media and societal pressure. The media, such as TV and fashion magazines, frequently feature a parade of skinny models and actors. These images seem to equate thinness with success and popularity. But whether the media merely reflect social values or actually drive them isn&apost clear. - Sports, work or artistic pressures. Athletes, actors, dancers and models are at a higher risk of eating disorders. Coaches and parents may inadvertently raise the risk by encouraging young athletes to lose weight, maintain a low weight and restrict eating for better performance. Bulimia may cause numerous serious and even life-threatening complications. Possible complications include: - Dehydration, which can lead to major medical problems, such as kidney failure - Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or heart failure - Severe tooth decay and gum disease - Absent or irregular periods in females - Digestive problems, and possibly a dependence on laxatives to have bowel movements - Anxiety and depression - Misuse of alcohol or drugs - Suicide If your doctor suspects you have bulimia, he or she will typically perform: - A complete physical exam - Blood and urine tests - A psychological evaluation, including a discussion of your eating habits and attitude toward food Your doctor may also request additional tests to help pinpoint a diagnosis, rule out medical causes for weight changes and check for any related complications. Criteria for diagnosis For a diagnosis of bulimia, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, lists these points: - You recurrently have episodes of eating an abnormally large amount of food -- more than most people would eat in a similar amount of time and under similar circumstances, for example, in a two-hour time period - You feel a lack of control during bingeing, such as how much you&aposre eating and whether you can stop eating - You get rid of the extra calories from bingeing to avoid weight gain by vomiting, excessive exercise, fasting, or misuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications - You binge and purge at least once a week for at least three months - Your body shape and weight influence your feelings of self-worth too much - You don&apost have anorexia, an eating disorder with extremely restrictive eating behaviors The severity of bulimia is determined by the number of times a week that you purge. Even if you don&apost meet all of these criteria, you could still have an eating disorder. Don&apost try to diagnose yourself - get professional help if you have any eating disorder symptoms. When you have bulimia, you may need several types of treatment, although combining psychotherapy with antidepressants may be the most effective for overcoming the disorder. Treatment generally involves a team approach that includes you, your family, your primary care doctor or other health care provider, as well as a mental health provider and a dietitian experienced in treating eating disorders.

Although you can&apost treat bulimia on your own, in addition to professional treatment, follow these self-care tips for bulimia: - Stick to your treatment plan. Don&apost skip therapy sessions and try not to stray from meal plans, even if they make you uncomfortable. - Learn about bulimia. Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. - Get the right nutrition. If you aren&apost eating well or you&aposre frequently purging, it&aposs likely your body isn&apost getting all of the nutrients it needs. Eating regularly and not restricting your food intake is the first step in overcoming bulimia. Talk to your doctor about appropriate vitamin and mineral supplements. - Stay in touch. Don&apost isolate yourself from caring family members and friends who want to see you get healthy. Understand that they have your best interests at heart and that nurturing, caring relationships are healthy for you. - Be kind to yourself. Resist urges to weigh yourself or check yourself in the mirror frequently. These may do nothing but fuel your drive to maintain unhealthy habits. - Be cautious with exercise. Talk to your health care provider about what kind of physical activity, if any, is appropriate for you, especially if you exercise excessively to burn off post-binge calories. Dietary supplements and herbal products designed to suppress the appetite or aid in weight loss may be abused by people with eating disorders. Weight-loss supplements or herbs can have serious side effects and dangerously interact with other medications. If you use dietary supplements or herbs, discuss the potential risks with your doctor.
1.6	what are some common symptoms of bulimia	Bulimia: Bulimia is an eating disorder in which a person has regular episodes of eating a very large amount of food (bingeing) during which the person feels a loss of control over eating. The person then uses different ways, such as vomiting or laxatives (purging), to prevent weight gain. Many people with bulimia also have anorexia nervosa. Many more women than men have bulimia. The disorder is most common in teenage girls and young women. The person usually knows that her eating pattern is abnormal. She may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes. The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor. With bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include: - Forcing oneself to vomit - Excessive exercise - Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills) Purging often brings a sense of relief. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person&aposs weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include: - Spending a lot of time exercising - Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away - Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals - Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics A dental exam may show cavities or gum infections (such as gingivitis). The enamel of the teeth may be worn away or pitted because of too much exposure to the acid in vomit. A physical exam may also show: - Broken blood vessels in the eyes (from the strain of vomiting) - Dry mouth - Pouch-like look to the cheeks - Rashes and pimples - Small cuts and calluses across the tops of the finger joints from forcing oneself to vomit Blood tests may show an electrolyte imbalance (such as low potassium level) or dehydration. People with bulimia rarely have to go to the hospital, unless they: - Have anorexia - Have major depression - Need medicines to help them stop purging Most often, a stepped approach is used to treat bulimia. Treatment depends on how severe the bulimia is, and the person&aposs response to treatments: - Support groups may be helpful for mild bulimia without other health problems. - Counseling, such as talk therapy and nutritional therapy are the first treatments for bulimia that does not respond to support groups. - Medicines that also treat depression, known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for bulimia. Combining talk therapy with SSRIs may help, if talk therapy alone does not work. People may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being "cured" by therapy alone. Before a program begins, people should know that: - Different therapies will likely be needed to manage this disorder. - It is common for bulimia to return (relapse), and this is no cause for despair. - The process is painful, and the person and their family will need to work hard. The stress of illness can be eased by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Bulimia is a long-term illness. Many people will still have some symptoms, even with treatment. People with fewer medical complications of bulimia and those willing and able to take part in therapy have a better chance of recovery. Bulimia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time. For example, vomiting over and over can cause: - Stomach acid in the esophagus (the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach). This can lead to permanent damage of this area. - Tears in the esophagus - Dental cavities - Swelling of the throat Vomiting and overuse of enemas or laxatives can lead to: - Your body not having as much water and fluid as it should - Low level of potassium in the blood, which may lead to dangerous heart rhythm problems - Hard stools or constipation - Hemorrhoids - Damage of the pancreas Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of an eating disorder.

-1.9	what are some common symptoms of bulimia	Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apost pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&aposre resting - When you&aposre lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apost go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apost work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&aposs common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apost do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apost pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apost wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apost go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

2.0	what are some of the treatments available to males with klinefelter&aposs	Klinefelter syndrome (Treatment): If you or your son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your health care team may include a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders involving the body&aposs glands and hormones (endocrinologist), a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist. Although there&aposs no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it&aposs never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child&aposs teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues.

But, an infertility specialist may be able to help. Seeing a doctor called an endocrinologist may also be helpful.
-1.6	what are some of the treatments available to males with klinefelter&aposs	Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs. The person getting the chemotherapy and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

-1.8	what are some of the treatments available to males with klinefelter&aposs	Prostate cancer - treatment (Hormonal Therapy): Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body&aposs testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment.

-1.16666666667	what are symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder	What is Gallbladder Cancer?: Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine. Cancer of the gallbladder is rare. It is more common in women and Native Americans. Symptoms include - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) - Pain above the stomach - Fever - Nausea and vomiting - Bloating - Lumps in the abdomen It is hard to diagnose gallbladder cancer in its early stages. Sometimes doctors find it when they remove the gallbladder for another reason. But people with gallstones rarely have gallbladder cancer. Because it is often found late, it can be hard to treat gallbladder cancer. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination. NIH: National Cancer Institute
-1.66666666667	what are symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder	Gallbladder Cancer: The gallbladder lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver that helps digest fat. Almost all gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Gallbladder cancer is hard to diagnose in the early stages because there are no signs or symptoms. Gallbladder cancer may be found when the gallbladder is checked for gallstones or removed. - Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder. - Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer. - Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain. - Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. - Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. - Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder. - Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer. - Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain. - Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. - Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. - Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Tests and procedures to stage gallbladder cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for gallbladder cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - For gallbladder cancer, stages are also grouped according to how the cancer may be treated.

-1.5	what are symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder	Gallbladder cancer (Diagnosis): Diagnosing gallbladder cancer Tests and procedures used to diagnose gallbladder cancer include: - Blood tests. Blood tests to evaluate your liver function may help your doctor determine what&aposs causing your signs and symptoms. - Procedures to create images of the gallbladder. Imaging tests that can create pictures of the gallbladder include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Determining the extent of gallbladder cancer Once your doctor diagnoses your gallbladder cancer, he or she works to find the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your gallbladder cancer&aposs stage helps determine your prognosis and your treatment options. Tests and procedures used to stage gallbladder cancer include: - Exploratory surgery. Your doctor may recommend surgery to look inside your abdomen for signs that gallbladder cancer has spread. In a procedure called laparoscopy, the surgeon makes a small incision in your abdomen and inserts a tiny camera. The camera allows the surgeon to examine organs surrounding your gallbladder for signs that the cancer has spread. - Tests to examine the bile ducts. Your doctor may recommend procedures to inject dye into the bile ducts. This is followed by an imaging test that records where the dye goes. These tests can show blockages in the bile ducts. These tests may include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. - Additional imaging tests. Most people with gallbladder cancer will undergo a series of scans to help determine whether the cancer has spread or remains localized. Which scans should be performed vary depending on your circumstances. Common scans include a CT of the chest and abdomen, ultrasonography, and an MRI of the liver. Stages of gallbladder cancer The stages of gallbladder cancer are: - Stage I. At this stage, gallbladder cancer is confined to the inner layers of the gallbladder. - Stage II. This stage of gallbladder cancer has grown to invade the outer layer of the gallbladder. - Stage III. At this stage, gallbladder cancer has grown to invade one or more nearby organs, such as the liver, small intestine or stomach. The gallbladder cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage IV. The latest stage of gallbladder cancer includes large tumors that involve multiple nearby organs and tumors of any size that have spread to distant areas of the body.
2.0	what are symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder	Gallbladder removal - open (Why the Procedure is Performed): You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally. Common symptoms may include: - Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas - Nausea and vomiting - Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain) The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely. In some cases, the surgeon needs to switch to an open surgery if laparoscopic surgery cannot be successfully continued. Other reasons for removing the gallbladder by open surgery: - Unexpected bleeding during the laparoscopic operation - Obesity - Pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas) - Pregnancy (third trimester) - Severe liver problems - Past surgeries in the same area of your belly
-0.5	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Overview): Childhood obesity is a serious medical condition that affects children and adolescents. Children who are obese are above the normal weight for their age and height. Childhood obesity is particularly troubling because the extra pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once considered adult problems - diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Many obese children become obese adults, especially if one or both parents are obese. Childhood obesity can also lead to poor self-esteem and depression. One of the best strategies to reduce childhood obesity is to improve the eating and exercise habits of your entire family. Treating and preventing childhood obesity helps protect your child&aposs health now and in the future.
1.8	what are the causes of childhood obesity	What causes Obesity?: Taking in more calories than your body burns can lead to obesity. This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by: - Eating more food than your body can use - Drinking too much alcohol - Not getting enough exercise Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost. Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally. The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active. - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals. - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past. - People with little free time may have less time to exercise. The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time. Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including: - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics Other things that can cause weight gain are: - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting. - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause. - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy.
2.0	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Causes): Lifestyle issues - too little activity and too many calories from food and drinks - are the main contributors to childhood obesity. But genetic and hormonal factors might play a role as well. For example, recent research has found that changes in digestive hormones can affect the signals that let you know you&aposre full.
0.6	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Lifestyle and home remedies): Addressing a woman&aposs health and weight before she conceives could lead to improvements in childhood obesity. If you&aposre overweight and thinking of becoming pregnant, losing weight and eating well might affect your child&aposs future. Eating well throughout pregnancy might also have a positive impact on your baby&aposs later food choices. To give your infant a healthy start, the World Health Organization recommends exclusively breast-feeding for 6 months. If your child is overweight or obese, his or her best chance to achieve and maintain a healthy weight is to start eating a healthy diet and exercising more. Here are some steps you can take at home to help your child succeed: - Be a role model. Choose healthy foods and active pastimes for yourself. If you need to lose weight, doing so will motivate your child to do likewise. - Involve the whole family. Make healthy eating a priority and emphasize how important it is for everyone to be physically active. This avoids singling out the child who is overweight.
-0.9	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Complications): Childhood obesity can have complications for your child&aposs physical, social and emotional well-being. Physical complications - Type 2 diabetes. This chronic condition affects the way your child&aposs body uses sugar (glucose). Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. - Metabolic syndrome. This cluster of conditions can put your child at risk of heart disease, diabetes or other health problems. Conditions include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high triglycerides, low HDL ("good") cholesterol and excess abdominal fat. - High cholesterol and high blood pressure. A poor diet can cause your child to develop one or both of these conditions. These factors can contribute to the buildup of plaques in the arteries. These plaques can cause arteries to narrow and harden, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke later in life. - Asthma. Children who are overweight or obese might be more likely to have asthma. - Sleep disorders. Obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which a child&aposs breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This disorder, which usually causes no symptoms, causes fatty deposits to build up in the liver. NAFLD can lead to scarring and liver damage. Social and emotional complications - Low self-esteem and being bullied. Children often tease or bully their overweight peers, who suffer a loss of self-esteem and an increased risk of depression as a result. - Behavior and learning problems. Overweight children tend to have more anxiety and poorer social skills than normal-weight children do. These problems might lead children who are overweight to act out and disrupt their classrooms at one extreme, or to withdraw socially at the other. - Depression. Low self-esteem can create overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, which can lead to depression in some children who are overweight.
-0.6	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Treatment): Treatment for childhood obesity is based on your child&aposs age and if he or she has other medical conditions. Treatment usually includes changes in your child&aposs eating habits and physical activity level. In certain circumstances, treatment might include medications or weight-loss surgery. Treatment for children who are overweight The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children older than 2 and adolescents whose weight falls in the overweight category be put on a weight-maintenance program to slow the progress of weight gain. This strategy allows the child to add inches in height but not pounds, causing BMI to drop over time into a healthier range. Treatment for children who are obese Children ages 6 to 11 who are obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits for gradual weight loss of no more than 1 pound (or about 0.5 kilogram) a month. Older children and adolescents who are obese or severely obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits to aim for weight loss of up to 2 pounds (or about 1 kilogram) a week. The methods for maintaining your child&aposs current weight or losing weight are the same: Your child needs to eat a healthy diet - both in terms of type and amount of food - and increase physical activity. Success depends largely on your commitment to helping your child make these changes. Healthy eating Parents are the ones who buy groceries, cook meals and decide where the food is eaten. Even small changes can make a big difference in your child&aposs health. - When food shopping, choose fruits and vegetables. Cut back on convenience foods - such as cookies, crackers and prepared meals - which are often high in sugar, fat and calories. Always have healthy snacks available. - Limit sweetened beverages. This includes those that contain fruit juice. These drinks provide little nutritional value in exchange for their high calories. They also can make your child feel too full to eat healthier foods. - Limit fast food. Many of the menu options are high in fat and calories. - Sit down together for family meals. Make it an event - a time to share news and tell stories. Discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen, which can lead to fast eating and lowered awareness of amount eaten. - Serve appropriate portion sizes. Children don&apost need as much food as adults do. Allow your child to eat until he or she is full, even if that means leaving food on the plate. And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often significantly oversized. Physical activity A critical part of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, especially for children, is physical activity. It burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day. Good habits established in childhood help adolescents maintain healthy weights despite the hormonal changes, rapid growth and social influences that often lead to overeating. And active children are more likely to become fit adults. To increase your child&aposs activity level: - Limit TV and recreational computer time. Time spent watching television or using computers, smartphones or tablets is known as screen time. Children younger than 18 months should avoid all screen time, except for video-chatting with family and friends. For older preschooolers, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programming. - Emphasize activity, not exercise. Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day. Your child&aposs activity doesn&apost have to be a structured exercise program - the object is to get him or her moving. Free-play activities - such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope - can be great for burning calories and improving fitness. - Find activities your child likes. For instance, if your child is artistically inclined, go on a nature hike to collect leaves and rocks that your child can use to make a collage. If your child likes to climb, head for the nearest neighborhood jungle gym or climbing wall. If your child likes to read, then walk or bike to the neighborhood library for a book. Medications Medication might be prescribed for some adolescents as part of an overall weight-loss plan. The risks of taking a prescription medication over the long term are unknown, and the medication&aposs effect on weight loss and weight maintenance for adolescents is still in question. Weight-loss surgery Weight-loss surgery may be an option for severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on future growth and development are largely unknown. Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is uncommon. But your doctor might recommend this surgery if your child&aposs weight poses a greater health threat than do the potential risks of surgery. It&aposs important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist and dietitian. Weight-loss surgery isn&apost a miracle cure. It doesn&apost guarantee that an adolescent will lose all of his or her excess weight or be able to keep it off long term. And surgery doesn&apost replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity.
-0.7	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Diagnosis): As part of regular well-child care, the doctor calculates your child&aposs BMI and determines where it falls on the BMI-for-age growth chart. The BMI helps indicate if your child is overweight for his or her age and height. Using the growth chart, your doctor determines your child&aposs percentile, meaning how your child compares with other children of the same sex and age. For example, if your child is in the 80th percentile, it means that compared with other children of the same sex and age, 80 percent have a lower weight or BMI. Cutoff points on these growth charts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, help identify children who are overweight and obese: - BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles - overweight - BMI 95th percentile or above - obesity Because BMI doesn&apost consider things such as being muscular or having a larger than average body frame and because growth patterns vary greatly among children, your doctor also factors in your child&aposs growth and development. This helps determine whether your child&aposs weight is a health concern. In addition to BMI and charting weight on the growth charts, the doctor evaluates: - Your family&aposs history of obesity and weight-related health problems, such as diabetes - Your child&aposs eating habits - Your child&aposs activity level - Other health conditions your child may have - Psychosocial history, including incidences of depression and sleep disturbances and sadness and whether your child has friends or is the target of bullying Blood tests Your child&aposs doctor might order blood tests if he or she finds that your child is obese. These tests might include: - A cholesterol test - A blood sugar test - Other blood tests to check for hormone imbalances, vitamin D deficiency or other conditions associated with obesity Some of these tests require that your child not eat or drink anything before the test. Ask if your child needs to fast before a blood test and for how long.
1.9	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Risk factors): Many factors - usually working in combination - increase your child&aposs risk of becoming overweight: - Diet. Regularly eating high-calorie foods, such as fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks, can easily cause your child to gain weight. Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain, and more and more evidence points to sugary drinks, including fruit juices, as culprits in obesity in some people. - Lack of exercise. Children who don&apost exercise much are more likely to gain weight because they don&apost burn as many calories. Too much time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, also contributes to the problem. - Family factors. If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on weight. This is especially true in an environment where high-calorie foods are always available and physical activity isn&apost encouraged. - Psychological factors. Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child&aposs risk of obesity. Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom. Their parents may have similar tendencies. - Socioeconomic factors. People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, they may opt for convenience foods that don&apost spoil quickly, such as frozen meals, crackers and cookies. In addition, people who live in lower income neighborhoods might not have access to a safe place to exercise.
-0.8	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Childhood obesity (Symptoms): Not all children carrying extra pounds are overweight or obese. Some children have larger than average body frames. And children normally carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know just by looking at your child if weight is a health concern. The body mass index (BMI), which provides a guideline of weight in relation to height, is the accepted measure of overweight and obesity. Your child&aposs doctor can help you figure out if your child&aposs weight could pose health problems by using growth charts, the BMI and, if necessary, other tests. When to see a doctor If you&aposre worried that your child is putting on too much weight, talk to his or her doctor. Your child&aposs doctor will consider your child&aposs history of growth and development, your family&aposs weight-for-height history, and where your child lands on the growth charts. This can help determine if your child&aposs weight is in an unhealthy range.
0.7	what are the causes of childhood obesity	Overweight and Obesity (Risk Factors): There are many risk factors for overweight and obesity. Some risk factors can be changed, such as unhealthy lifestyle habits and environments. Other risk factors, such as age, family history and genetics, race and ethnicity, and sex, cannot be changed. Heathy lifestyle changes can decrease your risk for developing overweight and obesity. Unhealthy lifestyle habits Lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, not enough sleep, and high amounts of stress can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Lack of physical activity Lack of physical activity due to high amounts of TV, computer, videogame or other screen usage has been associated with a high body mass index. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as being physically active and reducing screen time, can help you aim for a healthy weight. Unhealthy eating behaviors Some unhealthy eating behaviors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Eating more calories than you use. The amount of calories you need will vary based on your sex, age, and physical activity level. Find out your daily calorie needs or goals with the Body Weight Planner.

Not enough sleep Many studies have seen a high BMI in people who do not get enough sleep. Some studies have seen a relationship between sleep and the way our bodies use nutrients for energy and how lack of sleep can affect hormones that control hunger urges. Visit our Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency Health Topic for more information about lack of sleep. High amounts of stress Acute stress and chronic stress affect the brain and trigger the production of hormones, such as cortisol, that control our energy balances and hunger urges. Acute stress can trigger hormone changes that make you not want to eat. If the stress becomes chronic, hormone changes can make you eat more and store more fat. Age Childhood obesity remains a serious problem in the United States, and some populations are more at risk for childhood obesity than others. The risk of unhealthy weight gain increases as you age. Adults who have a healthy BMI often start to gain weight in young adulthood and continue to gain weight until 60 to 65 years old, when they tend to start losing weight. Unhealthy environments Many environmental factors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity:   social factors such as having a low socioeconomic status or an unhealthy social or unsafe environment in the neighborhood  built environment factors such as easy access to unhealthy fast foods, limited access to recreational facilities or parks, and few safe or easy ways to walk in your neighborhood exposure to chemicals known as obesogens that can change hormones and increase fatty tissue in our bodies Family history and genetics Genetic studies have found that overweight and obesity can run in families, so it is possible that our genes or DNA can cause these conditions. Research studies have found that certain DNA elements are associated with obesity. Read more Did you know obesity can change your DNA and the DNA you pass on to your children? Learn more about these DNA changes. Eating too much or eating too little during your pregnancy can change your baby’s DNA and can affect how your child stores and uses fat later in life. Also, studies have shown that obese fathers have DNA changes in their sperm that can be passed on to their children. Race or ethnicity Overweight and obesity is highly prevalent in some racial and ethnic minority groups. Rates of obesity in American adults are highest in blacks, followed by Hispanics, then whites. This is true for men or women. While Asian men and women have the lowest rates of unhealthy BMIs, they may have high amounts of unhealthy fat in the abdomen. Samoans may be at risk for overweight and obesity because they may carry a DNA variant that is associated with increased BMI but not with common obesity-related complications. Sex In the United States, obesity is more common in black or Hispanic women than in black or Hispanic men. A person’s sex may also affect the way the body stores fat. For example, women tend to store less unhealthy fat in the abdomen than men do. Overweight and obesity is also common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is an endocrine condition that causes large ovaries and prevents proper ovulation, which can reduce fertility.    
1.77777777778	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis - Birth defects of the heart - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) - Heart failure - Heart valve disease - HIV infection - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) - Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension.
-0.777777777778	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	How to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension?: Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they&aposre often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it&aposs working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that&aposs causing or contributing to PH. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart&aposs electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart&aposs rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung&aposs blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don&apost cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You&aposre comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You&aposre comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You&aposre not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one.
-0.888888888889	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Treatment): There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: - Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH - Oxygen therapy at home - Heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: - Avoid pregnancy - Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting - Avoid traveling to high altitudes - Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine - Stop smoking
2.0	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Summary): Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal.
1.55555555556	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease) - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs&apos air sacs (interstitium) - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It&aposs most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.
0.333333333333	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs&apos arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart&aposs lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren&apost curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life. The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years. As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: - Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest - Fatigue - Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope) - Chest pressure or pain - Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites) - Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis) - Racing pulse or heart palpitations Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs.

This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You&aposre a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults - You&aposre overweight - You have a family history of the disease - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it&aposs not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle&aposs wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you&aposll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart&aposs electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you&aposve had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you&aposll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It&aposs also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart&aposs size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs&apos arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle&aposs function and the blood flow in the lung&aposs arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you&aposll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you&aposve been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you&aposve been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don&apost have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You&aposre comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you&aposre physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Pulmonary hypertension can&apost be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it&aposs no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it&aposs inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn&apost be taken if you&aposre pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you&aposre pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you&aposre taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you&aposre taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don&apost control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Although medical treatment can&apost cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it&aposs recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don&apost smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can&apost stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you&aposre a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it&aposs important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It&aposs likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you&aposre taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you&aposre feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension.

1.88888888889	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. ("Inherited" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to "Types of Pulmonary Hypertension."
1.66666666667	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary Hypertension (Types): The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8–20 mmHg at rest. (Note that group 1 is called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and groups 2 through 5 are called pulmonary hypertension. However, together all groups are called pulmonary hypertension.) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause.

Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Left heart disease is likely the most common cause of PH. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 3 also includes PH associated with sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions. Examples include: Blood disorders, such as polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah) and essential thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah). Systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) and vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis). Systemic disorders involve many of the body&aposs organs.

0.857142857143	what are the main causes tooth loss?	Tooth abscess: A tooth abscess is a buildup of infected material (pus) in the center of a tooth. It is an infection caused by bacteria. A tooth abscess may form if there is tooth decay. It may also occur when a tooth is broken, chipped, or injured in other ways. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread from the root of the tooth to the bones supporting the tooth. Infection results in a buildup of pus and tissue swelling within the tooth. This causes a toothache. The toothache may stop if pressure is relieved. But the infection can remain active and continue to spread. This can cause more pain and can destroy tissue. The main symptom is a severe toothache. The pain is continuous. It does not stop. It can be described as gnawing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing. Other symptoms may include: - Bitter taste in the mouth - Breath odor - General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling - Fever - Pain when chewing - Sensitivity of the teeth to hot or cold - Swelling of the gum over the infected tooth, which may look like a pimple - Swollen glands of the neck - Swollen area of the upper or lower jaw, which is a very serious symptom Your dentist will closely look at your teeth, mouth, and gums. It may hurt when the dentist taps the tooth. Biting or closing your mouth tightly also increases the pain. Your gums may be swollen and red, and may drain thick material. Dental x-rays and other tests can help your dentist determine which tooth or teeth are causing the problem. The goals of treatment are to cure the infection, save the tooth, and prevent complications. Your dentist might prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. Warm saltwater rinses may help ease the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers may relieve your toothache and fever. Do NOT place aspirin directly on your tooth or gums. This increases irritation of the tissues and can result in mouth ulcers. A root canal may be recommended in an attempt to save the tooth. If you have a severe infection, your tooth may be removed, or you may need surgery to drain the abscess. Some people may need to be admitted to the hospital. Untreated abscesses may get worse and can lead to life-threatening complications. Prompt treatment cures the infection in most cases. The tooth can often be saved. These complications can occur: - Loss of the tooth - Blood infection - Spread of infection to soft tissue - Spread of infection to the jaw bone - Spread of infection to other areas of the body, which can cause brain abscess, inflammation in the heart, pneumonia, or other complications Call your dentist if you have a throbbing toothache that does not go away, or if you notice a bubble (or “pimple”) on your gums. Prompt treatment of dental decay reduces the risk of tooth abscess. Have your dentist examine any broken or chipped teeth right away.

-0.428571428571	what are the main causes tooth loss?	Impacted tooth (Causes): Teeth start to pass through the gums (emerge) during infancy. This happens again when permanent teeth replace the primary (baby) teeth. If a tooth does not come in, or emerges only partially, it is considered to be impacted. This most commonly happens with the wisdom teeth (the third set of molars). They are the last teeth to emerge. They usually come in between the ages of 17 and 21. An impacted tooth remains stuck in gum tissue or bone for various reasons. The area may be overcrowded, leaving no room for the teeth to emerge. For example, the jaw may be too small to fit the wisdom teeth. Teeth may also become twisted, tilted, or displaced as they try to emerge. This results in impacted teeth. Impacted wisdom teeth are very common. They are often painless and do not cause problems. However, some professionals believe an impacted tooth pushes on the next tooth, which pushes the next tooth. Eventually, this can cause a misaligned bite. A partially emerged tooth can trap food, plaque, and other debris in the soft tissue around it, which can lead to inflammation and tenderness of the gums and unpleasant mouth odor. This is called pericoronitis. The retained debris may also lead to the decay on the wisdom tooth or the neighboring tooth.
1.0	what are the main causes tooth loss?	Cavities/tooth decay (Complications): Cavities and tooth decay are so common that you may not take them seriously. And you may think that it doesn&apost matter if children get cavities in their baby teeth. However, cavities and tooth decay can have serious and lasting complications, even for children who don&apost have their permanent teeth yet. Complications of cavities may include: - Pain - Tooth abscess - Swelling or pus around a tooth - Damage or broken teeth - Chewing problems - Positioning shifts of teeth after tooth loss When cavities and decay become severe, you may have: - Pain that interferes with daily living - Weight loss or nutrition problems from painful or difficult eating or chewing - Tooth loss, which may affect your appearance, as well as your confidence and self-esteem - In rare cases, a tooth abscess - a pocket of pus that&aposs caused by bacterial infection - which can lead to more serious or even life-threatening infections
-0.714285714286	what are the main causes tooth loss?	Tooth extraction (Description): The procedure will take place in the dental office or hospital dental clinic. It may involve removing one or more teeth. You may be asked to take antibiotics before the procedure. - You will get a local anesthetic to numb the area around the tooth so you do not feel pain. - Your dentist may loosen the tooth in the gum using a tooth removal tool called an elevator. - Your dentist will then place forceps around the tooth and pull the tooth out from the gum. If you need a more complex tooth extraction: - You will be given sedation so you are relaxed and asleep, as well as an anesthetic so you are pain-free. - The surgeon may need to remove several teeth using the methods above. - For an impacted tooth, the surgeon may have to cut a flap of gum tissue and remove some surrounding bone. The tooth will be removed with forceps. If it is hard to remove, the tooth may be broken into pieces. After your tooth is removed: - Your dentist will clean out the gum socket and smooth out the bone that is left. - The gum will be closed with one or more stitches, also called sutures. - You will be asked to bite down on a damp piece of gauze to stop the bleeding.
-0.857142857143	what are the main causes tooth loss?	Tooth extraction: A tooth extraction is a procedure to remove a tooth from the gum socket. It is usually done by a general dentist, an oral surgeon, or a periodontist. The procedure will take place in the dental office or hospital dental clinic. It may involve removing one or more teeth. You may be asked to take antibiotics before the procedure. - You will get a local anesthetic to numb the area around the tooth so you do not feel pain. - Your dentist may loosen the tooth in the gum using a tooth removal tool called an elevator. - Your dentist will then place forceps around the tooth and pull the tooth out from the gum.

After your tooth is removed: - Your dentist will clean out the gum socket and smooth out the bone that is left. - The gum will be closed with one or more stitches, also called sutures. - You will be asked to bite down on a damp piece of gauze to stop the bleeding. There are several reasons people have a tooth pulled: - A deep infection in a tooth (abscess) - Overcrowded or poorly positioned teeth - Gum disease that loosens or damages teeth - Tooth injury from trauma - Impacted teeth that are causing problems, such as wisdom teeth (third molars) While uncommon, certain problems may occur: - The blood clot in the socket falls off days after the extraction - Infection - Nerve damage - Fractures caused by instruments, hardware, or implants used during the procedure - Damage to other teeth or restorations - Bruising and swelling at the treatment site - Discomfort or pain at the injection site - Incomplete relief of pain - Reaction to local anesthesia or other medicines given during or after the procedure - Slow healing of wounds - Improper bite, requiring additional procedures Tell your dentist about any medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines, and about your medical history. A tooth extraction can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. So be sure to tell your dentist if you have or have had conditions that may make you prone to infection. These may include: - Heart disease - Liver disease - Weakened immune system - Recent surgery, including joint replacement You may go home shortly after the procedure. - You will have gauze in your mouth to stop the bleeding. This will also help a blood clot to form. The clot fills the socket as the bone grows back in. - Your lips and cheek may be numb, but this will wear off in a few hours. - You may be given an ice pack for your cheek area to help keep swelling down. - As the medicine wears off, you may begin to feel pain. Your dentist will recommend pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). Or, you may be given a prescription for pain medicine. To help with healing: - Take any antibiotics or other medicines as prescribed. - You can apply a cold compress 10 to 20 minutes at a time to your cheek to reduce swelling and pain. Use ice in a towel or a cold pack. Do not place ice directly on the skin. - Avoid doing too much physical activity for the first couple of days. - Do not smoke. When eating or drinking: - Chew on the other side of your mouth. - Eat soft foods such as yogurt, mashed potatoes, soup, avocado, and bananas until the wound heals. Avoid hard and crunchy foods for 1 week. - Do not drink from a straw for at least 24 hours. This can disturb the blood clot in the hole where the tooth was, causing bleeding and pain. This is called dry socket. To care for your mouth: - Begin gently brushing and flossing your other teeth the day after your surgery. - Avoid the area near the open socket for at least 3 days. Avoid touching it with your tongue. - You may rinse and spit starting about 3 days after surgery. Your dentist may ask you to gently wash out the socket with a syringe filled with water and salt. - The stitches may loosen (this is normal) and will dissolve on their own. Follow up: - Follow up with your dentist as directed. - See your dentist for regular cleanings. Everyone heals at a different rate. It will take 1 to 2 weeks for the socket to heal. Affected bone and other tissue may take a bit longer to heal. Some people may have changes to the bone and tissue near the extraction. You should call your dentist or oral surgeon if you have: - Signs of infection, including fever or chills - Severe swelling or pus from the extraction site - Continued pain several hours after extraction - Excessive bleeding several hours after extraction - The blood clot in the socket falls out (dry socket) days after the extraction, causing pain - Rash or hives - Cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain - Trouble swallowing - Other new symptoms Updated by: Michael Kapner, DDS, General Dentistry, Norwalk, CT.

2.0	what are the risk factors of type ii diabetes	Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes: You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. Talk with your health care professional about any of the health conditions listed above that may require medical treatment. Managing these health problems may help reduce your chances of developing type 2 diabetes. Also, ask your health care professional about any medicines you take that might increase your risk.
1.57142857143	what are the risk factors of type ii diabetes	Who is at risk for Diabetes??: Diabetes is a serious, life-long disease. It can lead to problems such as heart disease, stroke, vision loss, kidney disease, and nerve damage. More than 8 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes and dont know it. Many people dont find out they have diabetes until they are faced with problems such as blurry vision or heart trouble. Certain factors can increase your risk for diabetes, and its important to know what they are. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. In an autoimmune reaction, antibodies, or immune cells, attach to the bodys own healthy tissues by mistake, signaling the body to attack them. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body&aposs immune system to attack the cells, but many believe that both genetic factors and environmental factors, such as viruses, are involved. Studies are now underway to identify these factors and prevent type 1 diabetes in people at risk. Learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes -- the most common form -- is linked closely to overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Many people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Being overweight can keep your body from using insulin properly. Genes also play an important role in a person&aposs risk for type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. Here are the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. - being over 45 years of age - being overweight or obese - having a first-degree relative -- a parent, brother, or sister -- with diabetes - being African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian American or Pacific Islander, or Hispanic American/Latino.

Learn more about the causes of type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Before people develop type 2 diabetes, they usually have prediabetes -- a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are more likely to develop diabetes within 10 years and also are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Prediabetes is increasingly common in the U.S. adult population. In 2012, about 86 million people in the U.S. had pre-diabetes, and 51% of those 65 or older had prediabetes. Learn more about prediabetes. Gestational Diabetes Some women develop diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. This is called gestational diabetes. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it has a lifelong risk for developing diabetes, mostly type 2.
0.428571428571	what are the risk factors of type ii diabetes	Type 2 diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong (chronic) disease in which there is a high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy. When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way. Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults. Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease. People with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms at first. They may not have symptoms for many years. Early symptoms of diabetes caused by a high blood sugar level may include: - Bladder, kidney, skin, or other infections that are more frequent or heal slowly - Fatigue - Hunger - Increased thirst - Increased urination - Blurred vision After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, and as a result, many other symptoms. Your doctor may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 11.1 mmol/L. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) two different times. - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the test result is 6.5% or higher. - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a special sugar drink. Diabetes screening is recommended for: - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 2 years - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors - Adults starting at age 45 every 3 years, or at a younger age if the person has risk factors If you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you need to work closely with your doctor. See your doctor as often as instructed. This may be every 3 months. The following exams and tests will help you and your doctor monitor your diabetes and prevent problems. - Check the skin and bones on your feet and legs. - Check if your feet are getting numb (diabetic nerve disease). - Have your blood pressure checked at least once a year (blood pressure goal should be 140/80 mm Hg or lower). - Have your A1C tested every 6 months if your diabetes is well controlled. Have the test every 3 months if your diabetes is not well controlled. - Have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked once a year. - Get tests once a year to make sure your kidneys are working well (microalbuminuria and serum creatinine). - Visit your eye doctor at least once a year, or more often if you have signs of diabetic eye disease. - See the dentist every 6 months for a thorough dental cleaning and exam. Make sure your dentist and hygienist know that you have diabetes. The goal of treatment at first is to lower your high blood glucose level. Long-term goals are to prevent complications. These are health problems from diabetes. The most important way to treat and manage type 2 diabetes is by being active and eating healthy foods. Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your doctor about seeing a diabetes nurse educator and a dietitian. LEARN THESE SKILLS Learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include: - How to test and record your blood glucose - What, when, and how much to eat - How to safely increase your activity and control your weight - How to take medicines, if needed - How to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar - How to handle sick days - Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments. MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR Checking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check. To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar. Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind: - Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day. - If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week. - You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime. - You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress. - You may need to test more often if you are having more frequent low blood sugar symptoms. Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROL Work closely with your health care providers to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like. Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes. Very obese people whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Regular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it: - Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine - Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight - Improves blood flow and blood pressure - Increases your energy level - Improves your ability to handle stress Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise. MEDICINES TO TREAT DIABETES If diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medicine. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar level in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug. Some of the most common types of medicines are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection. - Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - Biguanides - DPP IV inhibitors - Injectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs) - Meglitinides - SGL T2 inhibitors - Sulfonylureas - Thiazolidinediones You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Most commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys the insulin. PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including: - Eye disease - Kidney disease - Heart disease and stroke FOOT CARE People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection. Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected. To prevent problems with your feet: - Stop smoking if you smoke. - Improve control of your blood sugar. - Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year to learn if you have nerve damage. - Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems. - Treat minor infections, such as athlete&aposs foot, right away. - Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin. - Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you. There are many diabetes resources that can help you understand more about type 2 diabetes. You can also learn ways to manage your condition so you can live well with diabetes. Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure. Some people with type 2 diabetes no longer need medicine if they lose weight and become more active. When they reach their ideal weight, their body&aposs own insulin and a healthy diet can control their blood sugar level. After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems: - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind. - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body. - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet. - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness. - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection. - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Call 911 right away if you have: - Chest pain or pressure - Fainting, confusion or unconsciousness - Seizure - Shortness of breath These symptoms can quickly get worse and become emergency conditions (such as convulsions, hypoglycemic coma or hyperglycemic coma). Also call your doctor if you have: - Numbness, tingling, or pain in your feet or legs - Problems with your eyesight - Sores or infections on your feet - Symptoms of high blood sugar (extreme thirst, blurry vision, dry skin, weakness or fatigue, the need to urinate a lot) - Symptoms of low blood sugar (weakness or fatigue, trembling, sweating, irritability, trouble thinking clearly, fast heartbeat, double or blurry vision, uneasy feeling) You can help prevent type 2 diabetes by staying at a healthy body weight. You can get to a healthy weight by eating healthy foods, controlling your portion sizes, and leading an active lifestyle. Some medicines can also delay or prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk of developing the disease.

0.285714285714	what are the risk factors of type ii diabetes	Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn&apost use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease. A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including: - Blurry vision - Excess thirst - Fatigue - Frequent urination - Hunger - Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed. After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include: - Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, and blindness - Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot - Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction - Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure - Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections - Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes. Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. Blood tests: - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two different tests. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL (5.5 and 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher. - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a sugar drink (this test is used more often for type 2 diabetes). Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for: - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 3 years. - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors such as having high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister or brother with diabetes. - Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years. Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level. Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator. Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke. To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider&aposs instructions on managing your diabetes. Many resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications. Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure. Tight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control. After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems: - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind. - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body. - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet. - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness. - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection. - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Keeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you&aposre overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight even helps. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes. At this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.

1.71428571429	what are the risk factors of type ii diabetes	Type 2 diabetes (Risk factors): Researchers don&apost fully understand why some people develop type 2 diabetes and others don&apost. It&aposs clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: - Weight. Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. However, you don&apost have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes. - Fat distribution. If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs. - Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. - Family history. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. - Race. Although it&aposs unclear why, people of certain races - including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans - are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are. - Age. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. That&aposs probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults. - Prediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes. - Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you&aposre also at risk of type 2 diabetes. - Polycystic ovarian syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome - a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity - increases the risk of diabetes.
-1.85714285714	what are the risk factors of type ii diabetes	Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors (RISK FACTORS): High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels Cholesterol High blood cholesterol is a condition in which your blood has too much cholesterol—a waxy, fat-like substance. The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack. Cholesterol travels through the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins. Two major kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body: Low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL cholesterol sometimes is called "bad" cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol to tissues, including your heart arteries. A high LDL cholesterol level raises your risk of CHD. High-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL cholesterol sometimes is called "good" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. A low HDL cholesterol level raises your risk of CHD. Many factors affect your cholesterol levels. For example, after menopause, women&aposs LDL cholesterol levels tend to rise, and their HDL cholesterol levels tend to fall. Other factors—such as age, gender, diet, and physical activity—also affect your cholesterol levels. Healthy levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol will prevent plaque from building up in your arteries. Routine blood tests can show whether your blood cholesterol levels are healthy. Talk with your doctor about having your cholesterol tested and what the results mean. Children also can have unhealthy cholesterol levels, especially if they&aposre overweight or their parents have high blood cholesterol. Talk with your child&aposs doctor about testing your child&apos cholesterol levels. To learn more about high blood cholesterol and how to manage the condition, go to the Health Topics High Blood Cholesterol article. Triglycerides Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of CHD, especially in women. High Blood Pressure "Blood pressure" is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to plaque buildup. All levels above 120/80 mmHg raise your risk of CHD. This risk grows as blood pressure levels rise. Only one of the two blood pressure numbers has to be above normal to put you at greater risk of CHD and heart attack.   Most adults should have their blood pressure checked at least once a year. If you have high blood pressure, you&aposll likely need to be checked more often. Talk with your doctor about how often you should have your blood pressure checked. Children also can develop high blood pressure, especially if they&aposre overweight. Your child&aposs doctor should check your child&aposs blood pressure at each routine checkup.  Both children and adults are more likely to develop high blood pressure if they&aposre overweight or have diabetes. For more information about high blood pressure and how to manage the condition, go to the Health Topics High Blood Pressure article. Diabetes and Prediabetes Diabetes is a disease in which the body&aposs blood sugar level is too high. The two types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body&aposs blood sugar level is high because the body doesn&apost make enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells, where it&aposs used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, the body&aposs blood sugar level is high mainly because the body doesn&apost use its insulin properly. Over time, a high blood sugar level can lead to increased plaque buildup in your arteries. Having diabetes doubles your risk of CHD. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. If you have prediabetes and don&apost take steps to manage it, you&aposll likely develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. You&aposre also at higher risk of CHD. Being overweight or obese raises your risk of type 2 diabetes. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, people who have prediabetes may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. They also may be able to lower their risk of CHD and heart attack. Weight loss and physical activity also can help control diabetes. Even children can develop type 2 diabetes. Most children who have type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes develops over time and sometimes has no symptoms. Go to your doctor or local clinic to have your blood sugar levels tested regularly to check for diabetes and prediabetes. For more information about diabetes and heart disease, go to the Health Topics Diabetic Heart Disease article. For more information about diabetes and prediabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&apos (NIDDK&aposs) Introduction to Diabetes. Overweight and Obesity The terms "overweight" and "obesity" refer to body weight that&aposs greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. More than two-thirds of American adults are overweight, and almost one-third of these adults are obese. The most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). You can use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&aposs (NHLBI&aposs) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you. Overweight is defined differently for children and teens than it is for adults. Children are still growing, and boys and girls mature at different rates. Thus, BMIs for children and teens compare their heights and weights against growth charts that take age and gender into account. This is called BMI-for-age percentile. Being overweight or obese can raise your risk of CHD and heart attack. This is mainly because overweight and obesity are linked to other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. For more information, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article. Smoking Smoking tobacco or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke raises your risk of CHD and heart attack. Smoking triggers a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Smoking also increases the risk of blood clots forming in your arteries. Blood clots can block plaque-narrowed arteries and cause a heart attack. Some research shows that smoking raises your risk of CHD in part by lowering HDL cholesterol levels. The more you smoke, the greater your risk of heart attack. The benefits of quitting smoking occur no matter how long or how much you&aposve smoked. Heart disease risk associated with smoking begins to decrease soon after you quit, and for many people it continues to decrease over time. Most people who smoke start when they&aposre teens. Parents can help prevent their children from smoking by not smoking themselves. Talk with your child about the health dangers of smoking and ways to overcome peer pressure to smoke. For more information, including tips on how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI&aposs "Your Guide to a Healthy Heart." For more information about children and smoking, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&apos (HHS&apos) Kids and Smoking Web page and the CDC&aposs Smoking and Tobacco Use Web page. Lack of Physical Activity Inactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop CHD as those who are active. A lack of physical activity can worsen other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, diabetes and prediabetes, and overweight and obesity. It&aposs important for children and adults to make physical activity part of their daily routines. One reason many Americans aren&apost active enough is because of hours spent in front of TVs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities. Some experts advise that children and teens should reduce screen time because it limits time for physical activity. They recommend that children aged 2 and older should spend no more than 2 hours a day watching TV or using a computer (except for school work). Being physically active is one of the most important things you can do to keep your heart healthy. The good news is that even modest amounts of physical activity are good for your health. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. For more information, go to HHS&apos "2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans," the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI&aposs "Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart." Unhealthy Diet An unhealthy diet can raise your risk of CHD. For example, foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise LDL cholesterol. Thus, you should try to limit these foods. It&aposs also important to limit foods that are high in sodium (salt) and added sugars. A high-salt diet can raise your risk of high blood pressure. Added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. This can cause you to gain weight, which raises your risk of CHD. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruits packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet sodas. Stress Stress and anxiety may play a role in causing CHD. Stress and anxiety also can trigger your arteries to tighten. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk of heart attack. The most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk of CHD if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar. Age In men, the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) increases starting around age 45. In women, the risk for CHD increases starting around age 55. Most people have some plaque buildup in their heart arteries by the time they’re in their 70s. However, only about 25 percent of those people have chest pain, heart attacks, or other signs of CHD. Gender Some risk factors may affect CHD risk differently in women than in men. For example, estrogen provides women some protection against CHD, whereas diabetes raises the risk of CHD more in women than in men. Also, some risk factors for heart disease only affect women, such as preeclampsia, a condition that can develop during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure. (Likewise, having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes or obesity, increases a woman’s risk of preeclampsia.) Family History A family history of early CHD is a risk factor for developing CHD, specifically if a father or brother is diagnosed before age 55, or a mother or sister is diagnosed before age 65.
1.85714285714	what are the symptoms for cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (Symptoms): Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it&aposs important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) - Wheezing - Breathlessness - Exercise intolerance - Repeated lung infections - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren&apost able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools - Poor weight gain and growth - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing.
2.0	what are the symptoms for cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (Symptoms): Symptoms in newborns may include: - Delayed growth - Failure to gain weight normally during childhood - No bowel movements in first 24 to 48 hours of life - Salty-tasting skin Symptoms related to bowel function may include: - Belly pain from severe constipation - Increased gas, bloating, or a belly that appears swollen (distended) - Nausea and loss of appetite - Stools that are pale or clay-colored, foul smelling, have mucus, or that float - Weight loss Symptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include: - Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs - Fatigue - Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps - Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite) - Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps Symptoms that may be noticed later in life: - Infertility (in men) - Repeated inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) - Respiratory symptoms - Clubbed fingers
-0.857142857143	what are the symptoms for cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (Complications): - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes). - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps). - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood. - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness. - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can&apost absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins. - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30. - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones. - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion. - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it&aposs possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure.
1.71428571429	what are the symptoms for cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s. Cystic fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States.

If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing. In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition. Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won&apost develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. - Family history. Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families. - Race. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways.

To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors may conduct several tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means treatment can begin immediately. In one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical (immunoreactive trypsinogen, or IRT) released by the pancreas. A newborn&aposs IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may also conduct genetic tests to test for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. To evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test when the infant is at least 2 weeks old. In a sweat test, doctors apply a sweat-producing chemical to a small area of skin. They then collect the sweat to test it and see if it&aposs saltier than normal. Testing may be done at a center specializing in cystic fibrosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren&apost screened at birth. Your doctor may suggest genetic and sweat tests for cystic fibrosis if you have recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), nasal polyps, chronic sinus or lung infections, bronchiectasis, or male infertility. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms and reduce complications. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended. Managing cystic fibrosis is complex, so consider obtaining treatment at a center staffed by doctors and other staff trained in cystic fibrosis. Doctors may work with a multidisciplinary team of doctors and medical professionals trained in cystic fibrosis to evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: - Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs - Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs - Treating and preventing intestinal blockage - Providing adequate nutrition Medications The options may include: - Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections - Anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs - Mucus-thinning drugs to help you cough up the mucus, which can improve lung function - Inhaled medications called bronchodilators that can help keep your airways open by relaxing the muscles around your bronchial tubes - Oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene mutations, doctors may recommend a newer medication called ivacaftor (Kalydeco). This medication may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with cystic fibrosis who are age 6 and older. The dose depends on your weight and age. Doctors may conduct liver function tests and eye examinations before prescribing ivacaftor and on a regular basis while you&aposre taking it to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. For people with a certain gene mutation who are age 12 and older, another drug (Orkambi) is available that combines ivacaftor with a medication called lumacaftor. The combination of these medications may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, some people may experience side effects such as chest discomfort and shortness of breath soon after starting the medication. Some people may also have high blood pressure while taking the medication. Doctors may monitor you for any side effects. Chest physical therapy Loosening the thick mucus in the lungs makes it easier to cough up. Chest physical therapy helps loosen mucus. It is usually done from one to four times a day. A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. Certain breathing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus. Your doctor will instruct you about the type of chest physical therapy he or she recommends for you. Mechanical devices also can help loosen lung mucus. These include a vibrating vest or a tube or mask you breathe into. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: - Physical exercise that may improve your condition - Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing - Nutritional counseling - Counseling and support - Education about your condition Surgical and other procedures - Nasal polyp removal. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. - Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Endoscopy and lavage. Mucus may be suctioned from obstructed airways through an endoscope. - Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can&apost absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest temporarily using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition while you sleep. This tube may be inserted in your nose and guided to your stomach, or it may be surgically implanted into the abdomen. - Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a section of bowel has folded in on itself, also may require surgical repair. - Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with cystic fibrosis - such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas problems and osteoporosis - can still occur after a lung transplant. You can manage your condition and minimize complications in several ways. Always talk to your doctor before starting home remedies. Cystic fibrosis can cause malnourishment because the enzymes needed for digestion can&apost reach your small intestine, preventing food from being absorbed. People with cystic fibrosis may need a significantly higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to maintain good lung function. It&aposs also important to drink lots of fluids, which can help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to develop a nutrition plan. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. In addition, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids - Supplemental high-calorie nutrition - Special fat-soluble vitamins - Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage - Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising - Adequate water during hot weather In addition to other usual childhood vaccines, people with cystic fibrosis should have the annual flu vaccine and any other vaccines their doctor recommends. Cystic fibrosis doesn&apost affect the immune system, but children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to develop complications when they become sick. Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways, and strengthens your heart. For many people with cystic fibrosis, participating in sports can improve confidence and self-esteem. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Don&apost smoke in your home or car, and don&apost allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke is harmful for everyone, but especially for people with cystic fibrosis. Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a person who is sick. Hand-washing is the best way to protect against infection. You&aposll have ongoing care from your doctor and other medical professionals. Make sure to attend your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medications as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Contact your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as severe constipation, more mucus than usual, blood in your mucus or reduced energy.

2.0	what are the symptoms for prostate cancer	What are the symptoms of Prostate Cancer?: Symptoms Most cancers in their early, most treatable stages don&apost cause any symptoms. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine - inability to urinate - weak or interrupted flow of urine - painful or burning urination - difficulty in having an erection - painful ejaculation - blood in urine or semen - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If You Have Symptoms If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. The PSA Test The doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level. PSA levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. PSA tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. However, PSA tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. PSA screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (Screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) Most men with mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of PSA. A recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or PSA, may still have prostate cancer. Also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. Other Tests The doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. But to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. If Cancer is Present If a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. Doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. One way of grading prostate cancer, called the Gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. Another system uses G1 through G4. The higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. High-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors.
-1.83333333333	what are the symptoms for prostate cancer	Familial prostate cancer: Familial prostate cancer is a cluster of prostate cancer within a family. Most cases of prostate cancer occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. However, approximately 5% to 10% of prostate cancer cases are believed to be primarily caused by a genetic predisposition to the condition. [1] In many families, the underlying genetic cause is unknown; however, some of these cases are caused by changes ( mutations ) in the BRCA1 , BRCA2, HOXB13, or several other genes . Other cases are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. [2] High-risk cancer screening at an earlier age is typically recommended in men who have an increased risk for prostate cancer based on personal and/or family histories. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

-0.5	what are the symptoms for prostate cancer	Cryotherapy for prostate cancer (Summary): Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer.
-0.666666666667	what are the symptoms for prostate cancer	Cryotherapy for prostate cancer (When Cryosurgery is Used to Treat Prostate Cancer): This therapy is not as commonly used and is not as well accepted as other treatments for prostate cancer. Doctors do not know for certain how well cryosurgery works over time. There is not enough data to compare it with standard prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or brachytherapy. It can only treat prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate. Men who cannot have surgery because of their age or other health problems may have cryosurgery instead. It also may be used if cancer comes back after other treatments. It is generally not helpful for men with very large prostate glands.

0.7	what are the causes of headaches	Rebound headaches (Overview): Rebound headaches (medication-overuse headaches) are caused by regular, long-term use of medication to treat headaches, such as migraine. Pain relievers offer relief for occasional headaches. But if you take them more than a couple of days a week, they may trigger rebound headaches. It appears that any medication taken for pain relief can cause rebound headaches, but only if you already have a headache disorder. Pain relievers taken regularly for another condition, such as arthritis, have not been shown to cause rebound headaches in people who never had a headache disorder. Rebound headaches usually stop when you stop taking the pain medication. It&aposs tough in the short term, but your doctor can help you beat rebound headaches for long-term relief.
0.8	what are the causes of headaches	What causes Headaches - danger signs?: Problems with blood vessels and bleeding in the brain cancause as a headache. These include: - Abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth. This problem is called an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. - Blood flow to part of the brain stops. This is called a stroke. - Weakening of the wall of a blood vessel that can break open and bleed into the brain. This is known as a brain aneurysm. - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain. This iscalled a subarachnoid hemorrhage Other causes of headaches that should be checked by a doctor right awayinclude: - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudomotor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Infection in the brain or the tissue that surrounds the brain, as well as a brain abscess - Swollen, inflamed arterythat supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area (temporal arteritis)
0.6	what are the causes of headaches	Sex headaches (Causes): Any type of sexual activity that leads to orgasm can trigger sex headaches. Abrupt-onset and slow-to-build sex headaches can be primary headache disorders not associated with any underlying condition. Sex headaches that come on suddenly are more likely to be associated with: - A widening or bubble in the wall of an artery inside your head (intracranial aneurysm) - An abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain (arteriovenous malformation) that bleeds into the spinal fluid-filled space in and around the brain - Bleeding into the wall of an artery leading to the brain (dissection) - Stroke - Coronary artery disease - Use of some medications, such as birth control pills - Inflammation from certain infections Sex headaches associated with loss of consciousness, vomiting, stiff neck, other neurological symptoms and severe pain lasting more than 24 hours are more likely to be due to an underlying cause.
0.5	what are the causes of headaches	Spinal headaches (Causes): Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hole in the tough membrane (dura mater) that surrounds the spinal cord. This leakage decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache. Spinal headaches typically appear within 48 hours after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia. Sometimes epidural anesthesia may lead to a spinal headache as well. Although epidural anesthetic is injected just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord, a spinal headache is possible if the membrane is unintentionally punctured.
1.9	what are the causes of headaches	Headache: A headache is pain or discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck. Serious causes of headaches are rare. Most people with headaches can feel much better by making lifestyle changes, learning ways to relax, and sometimes by taking medicines. The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides. - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome. - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as: - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea) - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke There are things you can do to manage headaches at home, especially migraines or tension headaches. Try to treat the symptoms right away. When migraine symptoms begin: - Drink water to avoid getting dehydrated, especially if you have vomited. - Rest in a quiet, dark room. - Place a cool cloth on your head. - Use any relaxation techniques you have learned. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. When you get a headache, write down the following: - Day and time the pain began - What you ate and drank over the past 24 hours - How much you slept - What you were doing and where you were right before the pain started - How long the headache lasted and what made it stop Review your diary with your health care provider to identify triggers or a pattern to your headaches. This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them. Your provider may have already prescribed medicine to treat your type of headache. If so, take the medicine as instructed. For tension headaches, try acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Talk to your doctor if you are taking pain medicines 3 or more days a week. Some headaches may be a sign of a more serious illness. Seek medical help right away for any of the following: - This is the first headache you have ever had in your life and it interferes with your daily activities. - Your headache comes on suddenly and is explosive or violent. - Your headache is "the worst ever," even if you regularly get headaches. - You also have slurred speech, a change in vision, problems moving your arms or legs, loss of balance, confusion, or memory loss with your headache. - Your headache gets worse over 24 hours. - You also have a fever, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting with your headache. - Your headache occurs with a head injury. - Your headache is severe and just in one eye, with redness in that eye. - You just started getting headaches, especially if you are older than 50. - Your headaches are associated with vision problems, pain while chewing, or weight loss. - You have a history of cancer or immune system problem (such as HIV/AIDS) and develop a new headache. Your provider will take a medical history and will examine your head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, and nervous system. Your provider will ask many questions to learn about your headaches. Diagnosis is usually based on your history of symptoms. Tests may include: - Blood tests or a lumbar puncture if you may have an infection - Head CT scan or MRI if you have any danger signs or you have been having headaches for a while - Sinus x-rays - CT or MR angiography Updated by: Joseph V.

0.3	what are the causes of headaches	Headaches in children (Causes): A number of factors can cause your child to develop headaches. Factors include: - Illness and infection. Common illnesses such as colds, flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of headaches in children. More-serious infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, also can cause headaches, but are usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as fever and neck stiffness. - Head trauma. Bumps and bruises can cause headaches. Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention if your child falls hard on his or her head or gets hit hard in the head. Also, contact a doctor if your child&aposs head pain steadily worsens after a head injury. - Emotional factors. Stress and anxiety - perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents - can play a role in children&aposs headaches. Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness. - Genetic predisposition. Headaches, particularly migraines, tend to run in families. - Certain foods and beverages. Nitrates - a food preservative found in cured meats, such as bacon, bologna and hot dogs - can trigger headaches, as can the food additive MSG. Also, too much caffeine - contained in soda, chocolates, coffees and teas - can cause headaches. - Problems in the brain. Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess or bleeding in the brain can press on areas of the brain, causing a chronic, worsening headache. Typically in these cases, however, there are other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness and lack of coordination.
-0.9	what are the causes of headaches	Headache (When to Contact a Medical Professional): Some headaches may be a sign of a more serious illness. Seek medical help right away for any of the following: - This is the first headache you have ever had in your life and it interferes with your daily activities. - Your headache comes on suddenly and is explosive or violent. - Your headache is "the worst ever," even if you regularly get headaches. - You also have slurred speech, a change in vision, problems moving your arms or legs, loss of balance, confusion, or memory loss with your headache. - Your headache gets worse over 24 hours. - You also have a fever, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting with your headache. - Your headache occurs with a head injury. - Your headache is severe and just in one eye, with redness in that eye. - You just started getting headaches, especially if you are older than 50. - Your headaches are associated with vision problems, pain while chewing, or weight loss. - You have a history of cancer or immune system problem (such as HIV/AIDS) and develop a new headache.
0.4	what are the causes of headaches	Sinus headaches (Causes): Sinus headaches are usually associated with migraines or other forms of headaches. Sinus headaches are associated with pain and pressure in the face and sinuses and can cause nasal symptoms. Most of these headaches are not caused by sinus infections and should not be treated with antibiotics.
0.2	what are the causes of headaches	Headaches in children: Headaches in children are common and usually aren&apost serious. Like adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraine or stress-related (tension) headaches. Children can also have chronic daily headaches. In some cases, headaches in children are caused by an infection, high levels of stress or anxiety, or minor head trauma. It&aposs important to pay attention to your child&aposs headache symptoms and consult a doctor if the headache worsens or occurs frequently. Headaches in children usually can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications and other lifestyle measures. Children get the same types of headaches adults do, but their symptoms may differ. For example, migraine pain in children may last less than four hours, whereas in adults, migraines last at least four hours. Differences in symptoms may make it difficult to pinpoint headache type in a child, especially in a younger child who can&apost describe symptoms. In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently under certain categories. Migraines can cause: - Pulsating, throbbing or pounding head pain - Pain that worsens with exertion - Nausea - Vomiting - Abdominal pain - Extreme sensitivity to light and sound Even infants can have migraines. A child who&aposs too young to tell you what&aposs wrong may cry and hold his or her head to indicate severe pain. Tension-type headaches can cause: - A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck - Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head - Pain that&aposs not worsened by physical activity - Headache that&aposs not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days. Cluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually: - Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging from one headache every other day to eight a day - Involve sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts less than three hours - Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation Doctors use the phrase "chronic daily headache" (CDH) for migraine headaches and tension-type headaches that occur more than 15 days a month. CDH may be caused by an infection, minor head injury or taking pain medications - even nonprescription pain medications - too often. Most headaches aren&apost serious, but seek prompt medical care if your child&aposs headaches: - Wake your child from sleep - Worsen or become more frequent - Change your child&aposs personality - Follow an injury, such as a blow to the head - Feature persistent vomiting or visual changes - Are accompanied by fever and neck pain or stiffness A number of factors can cause your child to develop headaches. Factors include: - Illness and infection. Common illnesses such as colds, flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of headaches in children. More-serious infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, also can cause headaches, but are usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as fever and neck stiffness. - Head trauma. Bumps and bruises can cause headaches. Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention if your child falls hard on his or her head or gets hit hard in the head. Also, contact a doctor if your child&aposs head pain steadily worsens after a head injury. - Emotional factors. Stress and anxiety - perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents - can play a role in children&aposs headaches. Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness. - Genetic predisposition. Headaches, particularly migraines, tend to run in families. - Certain foods and beverages. Nitrates - a food preservative found in cured meats, such as bacon, bologna and hot dogs - can trigger headaches, as can the food additive MSG. Also, too much caffeine - contained in soda, chocolates, coffees and teas - can cause headaches. - Problems in the brain. Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess or bleeding in the brain can press on areas of the brain, causing a chronic, worsening headache. Typically in these cases, however, there are other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness and lack of coordination. Any child can develop headaches, but they&aposre more common in: - Girls after they reach puberty - Children who have a family history of headaches or migraines - Older teens To learn about the nature of your child&aposs headache, your doctor will likely look to: - Headache history. Your doctor asks you and your child to describe the headaches in detail, to see if there&aposs a pattern or a common trigger. Your doctor may also ask you to keep a headache diary for a time, so you can record more details about your child&aposs headaches, such as frequency, severity of pain and possible triggers. - Physical exam. The doctor performs a physical exam, including measuring your child&aposs height, weight, head circumference, blood pressure and pulse, and examining your child&aposs eyes, neck, head, shoulders and spine. - Neurological exam. Your doctor checks for any problems with movement, coordination or sensation. If your child is otherwise healthy and headaches are the only symptom, no further testing usually is needed. In a few cases, however, imaging scans and other evaluations can help pinpoint a diagnosis or rule out other medical conditions that could be causing the headaches. These tests may include: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. This imaging procedure uses a series of computer-directed X-rays that provide a cross-sectional view of your child&aposs brain. This helps doctors diagnose tumors, infections and other medical problems that can cause headaches. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRIs use a powerful magnet to produce detailed views of the brain. MRI scans help doctors diagnose tumors, strokes, aneurysms, neurological diseases and other brain abnormalities. An MRI can also be used to examine the blood vessels that supply the brain. - Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). If your doctor suspects that an underlying condition, such as bacterial or viral meningitis, is causing your child&aposs headaches, he or she may recommend a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted between two vertebrae in the lower back to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for laboratory analysis. Usually you can treat your child&aposs headache at home with rest, decreased noise, plenty of fluids, balanced meals and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers. If your child is older and has frequent headaches, learning to relax and manage stress through different forms of therapy may help, as well. Medications - OTC pain relievers. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) can typically relieve headaches for your child. They should be taken at the first sign of a headache. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. Aspirin has been linked to Reye&aposs syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns. - Prescription medications. Triptans, prescription drugs used to treat migraines, are effective and can be used safely in children older than 6 years of age. If your child experiences nausea and vomiting with migraines, your doctor may prescribe an anti-nausea drug. The medication strategy differs from child to child, however. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about nausea relief. Caution: Overuse of medications is itself a contributing factor to headaches (rebound headache). Over time, painkillers and other medications may lose their effectiveness. In addition, all medications have side effects. If your child takes medications regularly, including products you buy over-the-counter, discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. Therapies While stress doesn&apost appear to cause headaches, it can act as a trigger for headaches or make a headache worse. Depression and other mental health disorders also can play a role. For these situations, your doctor may recommend one or more behavior therapies, such as: - Relaxation training. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, which is accomplished by tensing one muscle at a time, and then completely releasing the tension, until every muscle in the body is relaxed. An older child can learn relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books or tapes. - Biofeedback training. Biofeedback teaches your child to control certain body responses that help reduce pain. During a biofeedback session, your child is connected to devices that monitor and give feedback on body functions, such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. Your child then learns how to reduce muscle tension and slow his or her heart rate and breathing. The goal of biofeedback is to help your child enter a relaxed state to better cope with pain. - Cognitive behavioral therapy. This therapy can help your child learn to manage stress and reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. During this type of talk therapy, a counselor helps your child learn ways to view and cope with life events more positively. OTC pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), are usually effective in reducing headache pain. Before giving your child pain medication, keep these points in mind: - Read labels carefully and use only the dosages recommended for your child. - Don&apost give doses more frequently than recommended. - Don&apost give your child OTC pain medication more than two or three days a week. Daily use can trigger a rebound headache, a type of headache caused by overuse of pain medications. - Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye&aposs syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns. In addition to OTC pain medications, the following can help ease your child&aposs headache: - Rest and relaxation. Encourage your child to rest in a dark, quiet room. Sleeping often resolves headaches in children. - Use a cool, wet compress. While your child rests, place a cool, wet cloth on his or her forehead. - Offer a healthy snack. If your child hasn&apost eaten in a while, offer a piece of fruit, whole-wheat crackers or low-fat cheese. Not eating can make headaches worse. Although they haven&apost been well-studied, a number of dietary supplements have been suggested to help children&aposs headaches, including: - Magnesium - Coenzyme Q10 - Vitamin D - Melatonin Check with your child&aposs doctor before trying any herbal products or dietary supplements to be sure they won&apost interact with your child&aposs medicine or have harmful side effects. Several alternative treatments may also be helpful for headaches in children, including: - Acupuncture. Acupuncture practitioners use extremely thin, disposable needles that generally cause little pain or discomfort. Some research has suggested that this treatment may help relieve headache symptoms. - Massage. Massage can help reduce stress and relieve tension, and may help ease headaches.
1.88888888889	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis - Birth defects of the heart - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) - Heart failure - Heart valve disease - HIV infection - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) - Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension.
-0.777777777778	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	How to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension?: Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they&aposre often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it&aposs working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that&aposs causing or contributing to PH. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart&aposs electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart&aposs rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung&aposs blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don&apost cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You&aposre comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You&aposre comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You&aposre not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one.
-0.888888888889	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Treatment): There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: - Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH - Oxygen therapy at home - Heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: - Avoid pregnancy - Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting - Avoid traveling to high altitudes - Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine - Stop smoking
0.333333333333	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Summary): Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal.
1.66666666667	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease) - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs&apos air sacs (interstitium) - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It&aposs most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.
1.44444444444	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs&apos arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart&aposs lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren&apost curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life. The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years. As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: - Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest - Fatigue - Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope) - Chest pressure or pain - Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites) - Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis) - Racing pulse or heart palpitations Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart.

This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You&aposre a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults - You&aposre overweight - You have a family history of the disease - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it&aposs not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle&aposs wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you&aposll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart&aposs electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you&aposve had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you&aposll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It&aposs also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart&aposs size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs&apos arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle&aposs function and the blood flow in the lung&aposs arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you&aposll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you&aposve been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you&aposve been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don&apost have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You&aposre comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you&aposre physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Pulmonary hypertension can&apost be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it&aposs no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it&aposs inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn&apost be taken if you&aposre pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you&aposre pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you&aposre taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you&aposre taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don&apost control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Although medical treatment can&apost cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it&aposs recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don&apost smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can&apost stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you&aposre a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it&aposs important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It&aposs likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you&aposre taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you&aposre feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension.
1.55555555556	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary hypertension (Risk factors): Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You&aposre a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults - You&aposre overweight - You have a family history of the disease - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude
2.0	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. ("Inherited" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to "Types of Pulmonary Hypertension."
1.77777777778	what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension	Pulmonary Hypertension (Types): The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8–20 mmHg at rest. (Note that group 1 is called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and groups 2 through 5 are called pulmonary hypertension. However, together all groups are called pulmonary hypertension.) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause. PAH that&aposs inherited (passed from parents to children through genes). PAH that&aposs caused by drugs or toxins, such as street drugs and certain diet medicines. PAH that&aposs caused by conditions such as: - Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) - HIV infection. - Liver disease. - Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that&aposs present at birth. - Sickle cell disease. - Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) HIV infection. Liver disease. Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that&aposs present at birth. Sickle cell disease. Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. PAH that&aposs caused by conditions that affect the veins and small blood vessels of the lungs. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Left heart disease is likely the most common cause of PH. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 3 also includes PH associated with sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions. Examples include: Blood disorders, such as polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah) and essential thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah). Systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) and vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis). Systemic disorders involve many of the body&aposs organs. Metabolic disorders, such as thyroid disease and glycogen storage disease. (In glycogen storage disease, the body&aposs cells don&apost use a form of glucose (sugar) properly.) Other conditions, such as tumors that press on the pulmonary arteries and kidney disease.
2.0	what blood tests confirm celiac disease	Celiac Disease (What tests do doctors use to diagnose celiac disease?): A health care professional may take a blood sample from you and send the sample to a lab to test for antibodies common in celiac disease. If blood test results are negative and your doctor still suspects celiac disease, he or she may order more blood tests.If a biopsy and other blood tests do not clearly confirm celiac disease, your doctor may order genetic blood tests to check for certain gene changes, or variants.4 You are very unlikely to have celiac disease if these gene variants are not present. Having these variants alone is not enough to diagnose celiac disease because they also are common in people without the disease. In fact, most people with these genes will never get celiac disease.If blood tests suggest you have celiac disease, your doctor will perform a biopsy to be sure. During a biopsy, the doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your small intestine during a procedure called an upper GI endoscopy.If a doctor suspects you have dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. For a skin biopsy, the doctor removes tiny pieces of skin tissue to examine with a microscope.A doctor examines the skin tissue and checks the tissue for antibodies common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue has the antibodies, a doctor will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, you may not need an intestinal biopsy.
1.8	what blood tests confirm celiac disease	Celiac disease - sprue (Exams and Tests): The following tests may be performed: - Bone density - Cholesterol (may be low) - Complete blood count (CBC - test for anemia) - Comprehensive metabolic panel - Folate level (serum) - Iron level (serum) - Prothrombin time - Vitamin B12 level (serum) - Vitamin D level Blood tests can detect antibodies, called antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) which may help detect the condition. The health care provider will order these antibody tests if celiac disease is suspected. If the tests are positive, upper endoscopy is often performed to sample a piece of tissue (biopsy) from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). The biopsy may show a flattening of the villi in the parts of the intestine below the duodenum. Genetic testing of the blood can also be done to help determine who may be at risk for celiac disease. A follow-up biopsy or blood test may be ordered several months after the diagnosis and treatment. These tests assess how well treatment is working. Normal results mean that you have responded to treatment. This confirms the diagnosis. However, this does not mean that the disease has been cured.
0.6	what blood tests confirm celiac disease	Celiac Disease: Celiac disease is a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine. The disease is triggered by eating foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye, and is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cakes. Many pre-packaged foods, lip balms and lipsticks, hair and skin products, toothpastes, vitamin and nutrient supplements, and, rarely, medicines, contain gluten.Celiac disease can be very serious. The disease can cause long-lasting digestive problems and keep your body from getting all the nutrients it needs. Celiac disease can also affect the body outside the intestine.Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity or wheat intolerance. If you have gluten sensitivity, you may have symptoms similar to those of celiac disease, such as abdominal pain and tiredness. Unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine.Celiac disease is also different from a wheat allergy. In both cases, your body’s immune system reacts to wheat. However, some symptoms in wheat allergies, such as having itchy eyes or a hard time breathing, are different from celiac disease. Wheat allergies also do not cause long-term damage to the small intestine.1 Celiac disease is a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine.

Wheat allergies also do not cause long-term damage to the small intestine.1 As many as one in 141 Americans has celiac disease, although most don’t know it.2 Although celiac disease affects children and adults in all parts of the world, the disease is more common in Caucasians and more often diagnosed in females. You are more likely to develop celiac disease if someone in your family has the disease. Celiac disease also is more common among people with certain other diseases, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and type 1 diabetes. If you have celiac disease, you also may be at risk forAddison’s disease Hashimoto’s disease primary biliary cirrhosis type 1 diabetes Long-term complications of celiac disease includemalnutrition, a condition in which you don’t get enough vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you need to be healthy accelerated osteoporosis or bone softening, known as osteomalacia nervous system problems problems related to reproductionRare complications can includeintestinal cancer liver diseases lymphoma, a cancer of part of the immune system called the lymph system that includes the gutIn rare cases, you may continue to have trouble absorbing nutrients even though you have been following a strict gluten-free diet. If you have this condition, called refractory celiac disease, your intestines are severely damaged and can’t heal. You may need to receive nutrients through an IV. Most people with celiac disease have one or more symptoms. However, some people with the disease may not have symptoms or feel sick. Sometimes health issues such as surgery, a pregnancy, childbirth, bacterial gastroenteritis, a viral infection, or severe mental stress can trigger celiac disease symptoms.If you have celiac disease, you may have digestive problems or other symptoms. Digestive symptoms are more common in children and can includebloating, or a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen chronic diarrhea constipation gas nausea pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stools that float stomach pain vomitingFor children with celiac disease, being unable to absorb nutrients when they are so important to normal growth and development can lead todamage to the permanent teeth’s enamel delayed puberty failure to thrive in infants mood changes or feeling annoyed or impatient slowed growth and short height weight lossAdults are less likely to have digestive symptoms and, instead, may have one or more of the following:anemia a red, smooth, shiny tongue bone or joint pain depression or anxiety dermatitis herpetiformis headaches infertility or repeated miscarriage missed menstrual periods mouth problems such a canker sores or dry mouth seizures tingling numbness in the hands and feet tiredness weak and brittle bonesAdults who have digestive symptoms with celiac disease may haveabdominal pain and bloating intestinal blockages tiredness that lasts for long periods of time ulcers, or sores on the stomach or lining of the intestineCeliac disease also can produce a reaction in which your immune system, or your body’s natural defense system, attacks healthy cells in your body. This reaction can spread outside your digestive tract to other areas of your body, including yourbones joints nervous system skin spleenDepending on how old you are when a doctor diagnoses your celiac disease, some symptoms, such as short height and tooth defects, will not improve.Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin rash that usually appears on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalp. The rash affects about 10 percent of people with celiac disease. The rash can affect people of all ages but is most likely to appear for the first time between the ages of 30 and 40. Men who have the rash also may have oral or, rarely, genital sores. Some people with celiac disease may have the rash and no other symptoms. Most people with celiac disease have one or more symptoms.

Men who have the rash also may have oral or, rarely, genital sores. Some people with celiac disease may have the rash and no other symptoms. Symptoms of celiac disease vary from person to person. Your symptoms may depend onhow long you were breastfed as an infant; some studies have shown that the longer you were breastfed, the later celiac disease symptoms appear how much gluten you eat how old you were when you started eating gluten the amount of damage to your small intestine your age—symptoms can vary between young children and adultsPeople with celiac disease who have no symptoms can still develop complications from the disease over time if they do not get treatment. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens to individuals who have particular genes. These genes are common and are carried by about one-third of the population. Individuals also have to be eating food that contains gluten to get celiac disease. Researchers do not know exactly what triggers celiac disease in people at risk who eat gluten over a long period of time. Sometimes the disease runs in families. About 10 to 20 percent of close relatives of people with celiac disease also are affected.3Your chances of developing celiac disease increase when you have changes in your genes, or variants. Certain gene variants and other factors, such as things in your environment, can lead to celiac disease. Celiac disease can be hard to diagnose because some of the symptoms are like symptoms of other diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose intolerance. Your doctor may diagnose celiac disease with a medical and family history, physical exam, and tests. Tests may include blood tests, genetic tests, and biopsy.Your doctor will ask you for information about your family’s health—specifically, if anyone in your family has a history of celiac disease.During a physical exam, a doctor most oftenchecks your body for a rash or malnutrition, a condition that arises when you don’t get enough vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you need to be healthy listens to sounds in your abdomen using a stethoscope taps on your abdomen to check for pain and fullness or swellingFor some people, a dental visit can be the first step toward discovering celiac disease. Dental enamel defects, such as white, yellow, or brown spots on the teeth, are a pretty common problem in people with celiac disease, especially children. These defects can help dentists and other health care professionals identify celiac disease.

Doctors in the United States do not routinely screen people for celiac disease. However, blood relatives of people with celiac disease and those with type 1 diabetes should talk with their doctor about their chances of getting the disease.Many researchers recommend routine screening of all family members, such as parents and siblings, for celiac disease.5 However, routine genetic screening for celiac disease is not usually helpful when diagnosing the disease. Doctors treat celiac disease with a gluten-free diet. Gluten is a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye that triggers a reaction if you have celiac disease. Symptoms greatly improve for most people with celiac disease who stick to a gluten-free diet. In recent years, grocery stores and restaurants have added many more gluten-free foods and products, making it easier to stay gluten free.Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with celiac disease. The dietitian will teach you how to avoid gluten while following a healthy diet. He or she will help youcheck food and product labels for gluten design everyday meal plans make healthy choices about the types of foods to eatFor most people, following a gluten-free diet will heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage. You may see symptoms improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. The small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. Complete healing can take several years in adults. Once the intestine heals, the villi, which were damaged by the disease, regrow and will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally.If you have dermatitis herpetiformis—an itchy, blistering skin rash—skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet. However, skin symptoms may return if you add gluten back into your diet. Medicines such as dapsone, taken by mouth, can control the skin symptoms. People who take dapsone need to have regular blood tests to check for side effects from the medicine.Dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, which is why you should stay on a gluten-free diet if you have the rash. Even when you follow a gluten-free diet, the rash may take months or even years to fully heal—and often comes back over the years. Doctors treat celiac disease with a gluten-free diet.

Even when you follow a gluten-free diet, the rash may take months or even years to fully heal—and often comes back over the years. In addition to prescribing a gluten-free diet, your doctor will want you to avoid all hidden sources of gluten.  If you have celiac disease, ask a pharmacist about ingredients inherbal and nutritional supplements prescription and over-the-counter medicines vitamin and mineral supplementsYou also could take in or transfer from your hands to your mouth other products that contain gluten without knowing it. Products that may contain gluten includechildren’s modeling dough, such as Play-Doh cosmetics lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm skin and hair products toothpaste and mouthwash communion wafersMedications are rare sources of gluten. Even if gluten is present in a medicine, it is likely to be in such small quantities that it would not cause any symptoms.Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. Some product makers label their products as being gluten-free. If a product label doesn’t list the product’s ingredients, ask the maker of the product for an ingredients list. If you don’t improve after starting a gluten-free diet, you may still be eating or using small amounts of gluten. You probably will start responding to the gluten-free diet once you find and cut out all hidden sources of gluten. Hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such asmodified food starch malt flavoring preservatives stabilizersIf you still have symptoms even after changing your diet, you may have other conditions or disorders that are more common with celiac disease, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, microscopic colitis, dysfunction of the pancreas, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Avoiding foods with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley, is critical in treating celiac disease. Removing gluten from your diet will improve symptoms, heal damage to your small intestine, and prevent further damage over time. While you may need to avoid certain foods, the good news is that many healthy, gluten-free foods and products are available.You should avoid all products that contain gluten, such as most cereal, grains, and pasta, and many processed foods. Be sure to always read food ingredient lists carefully to make sure the food you want to eat doesn’t have gluten. In addition, discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or health care professional who specializes in celiac disease.

In addition, discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or health care professional who specializes in celiac disease. Foods such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, rice, and potatoes without additives or seasonings do not contain gluten and are part of a well-balanced diet. You can eat gluten-free types of bread, pasta, and other foods that are now easier to find in stores, restaurants, and at special food companies. You also can eat potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour.In the past, doctors and dietitians advised against eating oats if you have celiac disease. Evidence suggests that most people with the disease can safely eat moderate amounts of oats, as long as they did not come in contact with wheat gluten during processing. You should talk with your health care team about whether to include oats in your diet.When shopping and eating out, remember toread food labels—especially on canned, frozen, and processed foods—for ingredients that contain gluten identify foods labelled “gluten-free;” by law, these foods must contain less than 20 parts per million, well below the threshold to cause problems in the great majority of patients with celiac disease ask restaurant servers and chefs about how they prepare the food and what is in it find out whether a gluten-free menu is available ask a dinner or party host about gluten-free options before attending a social gatheringFoods labeled gluten-free tend to cost more than the same foods that have gluten. You may find that naturally gluten-free foods are less expensive. With practice, looking for gluten can become second nature.If you have just been diagnosed with celiac disease, you and your family members may find support groups helpful as you adjust to a new approach to eating. In recent years, more people without celiac disease have adopted a gluten-free diet, believing that avoiding gluten is healthier or could help them lose weight. No current data suggests that the general public should maintain a gluten-free diet for weight loss or better health. 6, 7A gluten-free diet isn’t always a healthy diet. For instance, a gluten-free diet may not provide enough of the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals the body needs, such as fiber, iron, and calcium. Some gluten-free products can be high in calories and sugar.If you think you might have celiac disease, don’t start avoiding gluten without first speaking with your doctor. If your doctor diagnoses you with celiac disease, he or she will put you on a gluten-free diet. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a rule defining what “gluten-free” means on food labels. The "gluten-free" for food labeling rule requires that any food with the terms “gluten-free,” “no gluten,” "free of gluten,” and “without gluten” on the label must meet all of the definition’s requirements.While the FDA rule does not apply to foods regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including meat and egg products, it is often still observed.
0.4	what blood tests confirm celiac disease	Celiac disease: Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), sometimes called sprue or coeliac, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine&aposs lining and prevents absorption of some nutrients (malabsorption). The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia, and can lead to serious complications. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development, in addition to the symptoms seen in adults. There&aposs no cure for celiac disease - but for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and promote intestinal healing. The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and are different in children and adults. The most common signs for adults are diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss. Adults may also experience bloating and gas, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. However, more than half of adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: - Anemia, usually resulting from iron deficiency - Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia) - Itchy, blistery skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis) - Damage to dental enamel - Mouth ulcers - Headaches and fatigue - Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment - Joint pain - Reduced functioning of the spleen (hyposplenism) - Acid reflux and heartburn In children under 2 years old, typical signs and symptoms of celiac disease include: - Vomiting - Chronic diarrhea - Swollen belly - Failure to thrive - Poor appetite - Muscle wasting Older children may experience: - Diarrhea - Constipation - Weight loss - Irritability - Short stature - Delayed puberty - Neurological symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin disease that stems from intestinal gluten intolerance. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks. Dermatitis herpetiformis is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the disease may not produce noticeable digestive symptoms. Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash. Consult your doctor if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child&aposs doctor if your child is pale, irritable or failing to grow or has a potbelly and foul-smelling, bulky stools. Be sure to consult your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you&aposre tested for celiac disease, you may change the test results. Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask your doctor if you should be tested. Also ask your doctor about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes. Celiac disease occurs from an interaction between genes, eating foods with gluten and other environmental factors, but the precise cause isn&apost known. Infant feeding practices, gastrointestinal infections and gut bacteria might contribute to developing celiac disease. Sometimes celiac disease is triggered - or becomes active for the first time - after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress. When the body&aposs immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. If your villi are damaged, you can&apost get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat. Some gene variations appear to increase the risk of developing the disease. But having those gene variants doesn&apost mean you&aposll get celiac disease, which suggests that additional factors must be involved. The rate of celiac disease in Western countries is estimated at about 1 percent of the population. Celiac disease is most common in Caucasians; however, it is now being diagnosed among many ethnic groups and is being found globally. Celiac disease can affect anyone. However, it tends to be more common in people who have: - A family member with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis - Type 1 diabetes - Down syndrome or Turner syndrome - Autoimmune thyroid disease - Microscopic colitis (lymphocytic or collagenous colitis) - Addison&aposs disease - Rheumatoid arthritis Researchers estimate that only 20 percent of people with celiac disease may receive a diagnosis. Doctors may order two blood tests to help diagnose celiac disease. - Serology testing looks for antibodies in your blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten. - Genetic testing for human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) can be used to rule out celiac disease. If the results of these tests indicate celiac disease, your doctor may order an endoscopy to view your small intestine and to take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to analyze for damage to the villi. It&aposs important to be tested for celiac disease before trying a gluten-free diet. Eliminating gluten from your diet may change the results of blood tests so that they appear to be normal. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the only way to manage celiac disease. In addition to wheat, foods that contain gluten include: - Barley - Bulgur - Durum - Farina - Graham flour - Malt - Rye - Semolina - Spelt (a form of wheat) - Triticale Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian, who can help you plan a healthy gluten-free diet. Once you remove gluten from your diet, inflammation in your small intestine generally begins to lessen - usually within several weeks, though you may start to feel better in just a few days. Complete healing and regrowth of the villi may take several months to several years. Healing in the small intestine tends to occur more quickly in children than adults. If you accidentally eat a product that contains gluten, you may experience abdominal pain and diarrhea. Some people experience no signs or symptoms after eating gluten, but this doesn&apost mean it&aposs not harmful to them. Even trace amounts of gluten in your diet can be damaging, whether or not they cause signs or symptoms. Hidden gluten can be present in foods, medications and nonfood products, including: - Modified food starch, preservatives and food stabilizers - Prescription and over-the-counter medications - Vitamin and mineral supplements - Herbal and nutritional supplements - Lipstick products - Toothpaste and mouthwash - Envelope and stamp glue - Play-Doh Vitamin and mineral supplements If your nutritional deficiencies are severe, your doctor or dietitian may recommend taking vitamin and mineral supplements. You may need to supplement your levels of: - Calcium - Folate - Iron - Vitamin B-12 - Vitamin D - Vitamin K - Zinc Vitamins and supplements are usually taken in pill form. If your digestive tract has trouble absorbing vitamins, your doctor may give them by injection. You need to be sure that the vitamins and supplements are gluten-free. Follow-up care If you have celiac disease, you will need medical follow-up to make sure your symptoms have responded to a gluten-free diet. Doctors will also want to be sure you are getting the support you need to maintain the diet for life. They will use blood tests to monitor your response. The results of these tests, which are primarily designed as a way to detect celiac disease, usually become negative once you have been gluten-free for six to 12 months. If test results remain positive, then your doctor may try to find the reason, the most common being unintentional exposure to gluten in your diet. However, these tests are not perfect, and even if the results become negative, it is possible that you could still be exposed to a significant amount of gluten and continue to have symptoms and damage to your intestines. If you continue to have symptoms, or your symptoms recur, you may need a follow-up endoscopy with biopsies to ensure that healing has occurred. Adults typically have a greater need for follow-up testing, although children may require it, too. Some doctors recommend a routine re-biopsy if you are diagnosed in adulthood, as healing is often quite slow and uncertain. It also can be helpful to follow up with an expert dietitian for assistance in adapting to, and maintaining, a healthy, nutritious, gluten-free diet. Medications to control intestinal inflammation If your small intestine is severely damaged, your doctor may recommend steroids to control inflammation. Steroids can ease severe signs and symptoms of celiac disease while the intestine heals. Dermatitis herpetiformis If you have this itchy, blistering skin rash that sometimes accompanies celiac disease, your doctor may recommend a skin medication (dapsone) along with the gluten-free diet. Refractory celiac disease If you have refractory celiac disease, you may continue to have severe symptoms, or your symptoms may lessen but then relapse. In either case, your small intestine does not heal. When this happens, you likely will require evaluation in a specialized center. Refractory celiac disease can be quite serious and there is currently no proven treatment. People with refractory celiac disease should be treated by experts. There may be several causes for this condition. Doctors will often use steroid therapy - either a topical budesonide or systemic steroids such as prednisone. Sometimes, they will use the same medications used to treat other conditions. Potential future treatments While the only proven therapy for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, it is not perfect. People with celiac disease may often be accidentally exposed to gluten, possibly causing severe symptoms. Several treatments are in development for celiac disease. Some try to neutralize or bind to gluten. Others address the barrier of the intestine, blocking the leakiness that gluten can trigger. Still others target the body&aposs immune system. Researchers have also been trying to genetically modify wheat, but have not yet been successful. None of these treatments is likely to be approved within the next two to three years. However, given the number of different approaches, there is a good chance that there will be additional treatments available for celiac disease in the future. If you&aposve been diagnosed with celiac disease, you&aposll need to avoid all foods that contain gluten. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian, who can help you plan a healthy gluten-free diet. It&aposs important to get enough vitamins, nutrients, fiber and calcium in your diet. Here&aposs an overview of foods that contain gluten and gluten-free foods that are safe to eat. Avoid food and drinks containing: - Barley - Bulgur - Durum - Farina - Graham flour - Malt - Rye - Semolina - Spelt (a form of wheat) - Triticale - Wheat Packaged foods should be avoided unless they&aposre labeled as gluten-free or have no gluten-containing ingredients. In addition to cereals, pastas and baked goods - such as breads, cakes, pies and cookies - other packaged foods that may contain gluten include: - Beer - Candies - Gravies - Imitation meats or seafood - Processed luncheon meats - Salad dressings and sauces, including soy sauce - Self-basting poultry - Soups Certain grains, such as oats, can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing. Pure oats are not harmful for most people with celiac disease. In the United States, doctors generally recommend avoiding oats unless they have been specifically labeled gluten-free. Outside of the United States, different labeling laws for oats apply. Occasionally, even pure oats can be a problem for people with celiac disease. Many basic foods are allowed in a gluten-free diet, including: - Fresh meats, fish and poultry that aren&apost breaded, batter-coated or marinated - Fruits - Most dairy products - Potatoes - Vegetables - Wine and distilled liquors, ciders and spirits Grains and starches allowed in a gluten-free diet include: - Amaranth - Arrowroot - Buckwheat - Corn - Cornmeal - Gluten-free flours (rice, soy, corn, potato, bean) - Pure corn tortillas - Quinoa - Rice - Tapioca Carob is a potential substitute for gluten, but more research is needed about its effect on people with celiac disease. Fortunately for bread and pasta lovers with celiac disease, an increasing number of gluten-free products are available. If you can&apost find any at your local bakery or grocery store, check online. There are gluten-free substitutes for many gluten-containing foods. However, be aware that processed gluten-free foods may contain excessive fat and calories. There are no proven treatments that assist with celiac disease. Enzyme therapies that claim to digest gluten may be available in health food stores or other outlets, but there is no scientific evidence that they are effective in treating celiac disease.

-0.857142857143	what can cause hypoglycemia	Hypoglycemia (Complications): If you ignore the symptoms of hypoglycemia too long, you may lose consciousness. That&aposs because your brain needs glucose to function properly. Recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia early because untreated hypoglycemia can lead to: - Seizure - Loss of consciousness - Death Hypoglcemia can also contribute to: - Falls - Injuries - Motor vehicle accidents Hypoglycemia unawareness Over time, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness. The body and brain no longer produce signs and symptoms that warn of a low blood sugar, such as shakiness or irregular heartbeats. When this happens, the risk of severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia is increased. Undertreated diabetes If you have diabetes, episodes of low blood sugar are uncomfortable and can be frightening. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia may cause you to take less insulin to ensure that your blood sugar level doesn&apost go too low. But long-term high blood sugar levels can be dangerous too, possibly causing damage to your nerves, blood vessels and various organs.
-0.714285714286	what can cause hypoglycemia	What to do for Hypoglycemia?: Diabetes-related Hypoglycemia - When people with diabetes think their blood glucose level is low, they should check it and treat the problem right away. - To treat hypoglycemia, people should have a serving of a quick-fix food, wait 15 minutes, and check their blood glucose again. They should repeat the treatment until their blood glucose is 70 mg/dL or above. - People at risk for hypoglycemia should keep quick-fix foods in the car, at workanywhere they spend time. - People at risk for hypoglycemia should be careful when driving. They should check their blood glucose frequently and snack as needed to keep their level 70 mg/dL or above. Hypoglycemia Unrelated to Diabetes - In reactive hypoglycemia, symptoms occur within 4 hours of eating. People with reactive hypoglycemia are usually advised to follow a healthy eating plan recommended by a registered dietitian. - Fasting hypoglycemia can be caused by certain medications, critical illnesses, hereditary enzyme or hormonal deficiencies, and some kinds of tumors. Treatment targets the underlying problem.

They may slur their words and move clumsily. When to see a doctor Seek a doctor&aposs help immediately if: - You have what may be symptoms of hypoglycemia and you don&apost have diabetes. - You have diabetes and hypoglycemia isn&apost responding to treatment. Initial treatment of hypoglycemia is drinking juice or regular soft drinks, eating candy or taking glucose tablets. If this treatment doesn&apost raise your blood sugar and improve your symptoms, contact your doctor right away. Seek emergency help if: - Someone with diabetes or a history of recurring hypoglycemia has symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or loses consciousness
2.0	what can cause hypoglycemia	Hypoglycemia (Causes): Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can&apost enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven&apost eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don&apost eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else&aposs oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven&apost eaten (when you&aposre in a fasting state), but that&aposs not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven&apost had this surgery.
0.857142857143	what can cause hypoglycemia	congenital hyperinsulinism (Description): Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma. The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating.
-0.571428571429	what can cause hypoglycemia	Hypoglycemia (Treatment): Treatment of hypoglycemia involves: - Immediate initial treatment to raise your blood sugar level - Treatment of the underlying condition that&aposs causing your hypoglycemia to prevent it from recurring Immediate initial treatment The initial treatment depends on your symptoms. Early symptoms can usually be treated by consuming 15 to 20 grams of a fast-acting carbohydrate. Fast-acting carbohydrates are foods that are easily converted to sugar in the body, such as glucose tablets or gel, fruit juice, regular - not diet - soft drinks, and sugary candy such as licorice. Foods containing fat or protein aren&apost good treatments for hypoglycemia, because they affect the body&aposs absorption of sugar. Recheck blood sugar levels 15 minutes after treatment. If blood sugar levels are still under 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), treat with another 15 to 20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate, and recheck the blood sugar level again in 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until the blood sugar is above 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Once the blood sugar levels are back to normal, it&aposs important to have a snack or meal to help stabilize your blood sugar. This also helps the body replenish glycogen stores that may have been depleted during hypoglycemia. If your symptoms are more severe, impairing your ability to take sugar by mouth, you may need an injection of glucagon or intravenous glucose. Do not give food or drink to someone who is unconscious, as he or she may aspirate these substances into the lungs. If you&aposre prone to severe episodes of hypoglycemia, ask your doctor if a home glucagon kit might be appropriate for you. In general, people with diabetes who are treated with insulin should have a glucagon kit for low blood sugar emergencies. Family and friends need to know where to find the kit, and need to be taught how to use it before an emergency occurs. Treatment of the underlying condition Preventing recurrent hypoglycemia requires your doctor to identify the underlying condition and treat it. Depending on the underlying cause, treatment may involve: - Medications. If a medication is the cause of your hypoglycemia, your doctor will likely suggest changing the medication or adjusting the dosage. - Tumor treatment. A tumor in your pancreas is treated by surgical removal of the tumor. In some cases, partial removal of the pancreas is necessary.
-0.428571428571	what can cause hypoglycemia	Hypoglycemia (Diagnosis): If you use insulin or another diabetes medication known to lower blood sugar, and you have signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, test your blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter. If the result shows low blood sugar (under 70 mg/dL), treat accordingly. If you don&apost use medications known to cause hypoglycemia, your doctor will want to know: - What were your signs and symptoms? You may not exhibit signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during your initial visit with your doctor. In this case, your doctor may have you fast overnight (or for a longer period). This will allow low blood sugar symptoms to occur so that he or she can make a diagnosis. It&aposs also possible that you&aposll need to undergo an extended fast in a hospital setting. Or if your symptoms occur after a meal, your doctor will want to test your glucose levels after a meal. - What is your blood sugar level when you&aposre having symptoms? Your doctor will draw a sample of your blood to be analyzed in the laboratory. - Do your symptoms disappear when blood sugar levels increase? In addition, your doctor will likely conduct a physical examination and review your medical history.
0.8	what causes bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Risk factors): Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse
-0.3	what causes bipolar disorder	How to diagnose Bipolar disorder?: To diagnose bipolar disorder, the health care provider may do some or all of the following: - Ask whether other family members have bipolar disorder - Ask about your recent mood swings and for how long you have had them - Perform a thorough exam and order lab tests to look for other illnesses that may be causing symptoms that resemble bipolar disorder - Talk to family members about your symptoms and overall health - Ask about any health problems you have and any medications you take - Watch your behavior and mood
1.9	what causes bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You&aposve had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You&aposve had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you&aposve never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You&aposve had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing&aposs disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it&aposs diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It&aposs often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don&apost recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don&apost get the treatment they need. And if you&aposre like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn&apost get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you&aposll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you&aposll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you&aposre behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you&aposre having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You&aposll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it&aposs usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn&apost work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don&apost make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you&aposre taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what&aposs going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don&apost get better with medications, can&apost take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven&apost responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There&aposs less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child&aposs developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. You&aposll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who&aposs treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you&aposre taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. There isn&apost much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn&apost clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don&apost stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren&apost regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it&aposs natural doesn&apost mean it&aposs safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications.
-0.4	what causes bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Symptoms): There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You&aposve had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You&aposve had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you&aposve never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You&aposve had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing&aposs disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it&aposs diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It&aposs often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don&apost recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don&apost get the treatment they need. And if you&aposre like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn&apost get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.
2.0	what causes bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder (Causes): The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics.

2.0	what causes fungal pneumonia	Pneumonia (Causes): Bacteria, viruses, and fungi infections can cause pneumonia. These infections cause inflammation in the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs. This inflammation causes the air sacs to fill with fluid and pus. Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Many types of bacteria can cause bacterial pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the United States. If your pneumonia is caused by one of the following types of bacteria, it is called atypical pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire&aposs disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It&aposs usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However, Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis. This type of bacteria is a common cause of “walking pneumonia”. Chlamydia pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you&aposve had a viral cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia often affects just one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia. Read more Most of the time, the body filters bacteria out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. Read How the Lungs Work for more information. Sometimes bacteria manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if: Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter out the bacteria from the air that you breathe. For example, if you can&apost cough because you&aposve had a stroke or are sedated, bacteria may remain in your airways. When bacteria reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the bacteria. These cells cause inflammation in alveoli (air sacs) and can cause these spaces to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Viruses Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. The influenza or flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in children younger than one year old.  Other viruses can cause pneumonia such as the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about one to three weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia. Fungi Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It occurs in people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS or the long-term use of medicines that suppress their immune systems, such as those used to treat cancer or as part of organ or blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. Other fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia. The following are three fungi that occur in the soil in some parts of the United States and can cause some people to get pneumonia. Coccidioidomycosis. This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. It is the cause of valley fever. Histoplasmosis. This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus. This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.

This is more likely to occur if: Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter germs out of the air that you breathe For example, if you can&apost cough because you&aposve had a stroke or are sedated, germs may remain in your airways. ("Sedated" means you&aposre given medicine to make you sleepy.) When germs reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the germs. These cells cause the alveoli (air sacs) to become red and inflamed and to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Germs That Can Cause Pneumonia Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Some people, especially the elderly and those who are disabled, may get bacterial pneumonia after having the flu or even a common cold. Many types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you&aposve had a cold or the flu. This type of pneumonia often affects one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia. The most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is the bacterium Streptococcus (strep-to-KOK-us) pneumoniae, or pneumococcus (nu-mo-KOK-us). Lobar Pneumonia Another type of bacterial pneumonia is called atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia includes: Legionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire&aposs disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumonia. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old.

It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells). Chlamydophila pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Viruses Respiratory viruses cause up to one-third of the pneumonia cases in the United States each year. These viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old. Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia as well. The flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Other viruses that cause pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and more. Fungi Three types of fungi in the soil in some parts of the United States can cause pneumonia. These fungi are: Coccidioidomycosis (kok-sid-e-OY-do-mi-KO-sis). This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. Histoplasmosis (HIS-to-plaz-MO-sis). This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus (krip-to-KOK-us). This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings. Most people exposed to these fungi don&apost get sick, but some do and require treatment. Serious fungal infections are most common in people who have weak immune systems due to the long-term use of medicines to suppress their immune systems or having HIV/AIDS. Pneumocystis jiroveci (nu-mo-SIS-tis ye-RO-VECH-e), formerly Pneumocystis carinii, sometimes is considered a fungal pneumonia. However, it&aposs not treated with the usual antifungal medicines. This type of infection is most common in people who: Have HIV/AIDS or cancer Have had an organ transplant and/or blood and marrow stem cell transplant Take medicines that affect their immune systems Other kinds of fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia.
-0.444444444444	what causes fungal pneumonia	Pneumonia (Diagnosis): Sometimes pneumonia is hard to diagnose because it may cause symptoms commonly seen in people with colds or the flu. You may not realize it&aposs more serious until it lasts longer than these other conditions. Your doctor will diagnose pneumonia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor may be able to diagnose you with a certain type of pneumonia based on how you got your infection and the type of germ causing your infection. Medical history Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. To find out whether you have bacterial, viral, or fungal pneumonia, your doctor also may ask about: Any recent traveling you&aposve done Your hobbies Your exposure to animals Your exposure to sick people at home, school, or work Your past and current medical conditions, and whether any have gotten worse recently Any medicines you take Whether you smoke Whether you&aposve had flu or pneumonia vaccinations Physical exam Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. If you have pneumonia, your lungs may make crackling, bubbling, and rumbling sounds when you inhale. Your doctor also may hear wheezing. Your doctor may find it hard to hear sounds of breathing in some areas of your chest. Diagnostic tests If your doctor thinks you have pneumonia, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests. Chest x ray to look for inflammation in your lungs. A chest x ray is the best test for diagnosing pneumonia. However, this test won&apost tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia. Blood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infection. Blood culture to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream. If so, your doctor can decide how to treat the infection. Your doctor may recommend other tests if you&aposre in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems. Sputum test. Your doctor may collect a sample of sputum (spit) or phlegm (slimy substance from deep in your lungs) that was produced from one of your deep coughs and send the sample to the lab for testing. This may help your doctor find out if bacteria are causing your pneumonia. Then, he or she can plan your treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan to see how much of your lungs is affected by your condition or to see if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions. A CT scan shows more detail than a chest x ray. Pleural fluid culture. For this test, a fluid sample is taken from the pleural space (a thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity). Doctors use a procedure called thoracentesis to collect the fluid sample. The fluid is studied for bacteria that may cause pneumonia. Pulse oximetry. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Pneumonia can keep your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. If you&aposre very sick, your doctor may need to measure the level of oxygen in your blood using a blood sample. The sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. This test is called an arterial blood gas test. Bronchoscopy is a procedure used to look inside the lungs&apos airways. If you&aposre in the hospital and treatment with antibiotics isn&apost working well, your doctor may use this procedure. Your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose or mouth, down your throat, and into the airways. The tube has a light and small camera that allow your doctor to see your windpipe and airways and take pictures. Your doctor can see whether something is blocking your airways or whether another factor is contributing to your pneumonia. Your doctor may use this procedure to collect samples of fluid from the site of pneumonia (called bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL) or to take small biopsies of lung tissue to help find the cause of your pneumonia. Types of pneumonia Your doctor may also diagnosis you with a certain type of pneumonia. Pneumonia is named for the way in which a person gets the infection or for the germ that causes the infection. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). CAP is the most common type of pneumonia and is usually caused by pneumococcus bacteria. Most cases occur during the winter. CAP occurs outside of hospitals and other health care settings. Most people get CAP by breathing in germs (especially while sleeping) that live in the mouth, nose, or throat. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP). HAP is when people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. HAP tends to be more serious than CAP because you&aposre already sick. Also, hospitals tend to have more germs that are resistant to antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is when people who are on a ventilator machine to help them breathe get pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia is a type of CAP. It is caused by lung infections with less common bacteria than the pneumococcus bacteria that cause CAP. Atypical bacteria include Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae. Aspiration pneumonia. This type of pneumonia can occur if you inhale food, drink, vomit, or saliva from your mouth into your lungs. This may happen if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury, swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs. Aspiration pneumonia can cause lung abscesses.
-0.333333333333	what causes fungal pneumonia	Pneumonia: Pneumonia is a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of one or both sides of the lungs that causes the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. Symptoms can be mild or severe and may include a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the lung infection, your age, and your overall health. Pneumonia tends to be more serious for children under the age of five, adults over the age of 65, people with certain conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), or organ or blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. To diagnose pneumonia, your doctor will review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order diagnostic tests. This information can help your doctor determine what type of pneumonia you have. If your doctor suspects you got your infection while in a hospital, you may be diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. If you have been on a ventilator to help you breathe, you may have ventilator-associated pneumonia. The most common form of pneumonia is community-acquired pneumonia, which is when you get an infection outside of a hospital. Treatment depends on whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi are causing your pneumonia. If bacteria are causing your pneumonia, you usually are treated at home with oral antibiotics. Most people respond quickly to treatment. If your symptoms worsen you should see a doctor right away. If you have severe symptoms or underlying health problems, you may need to be treated in a hospital. It may take several weeks to recover from pneumonia.

-1.55555555556	what causes fungal pneumonia	Fungal arthritis (Causes): Fungal arthritis is a rare condition. It can be caused by any of the invasive types of fungi. The infection can result from an infection in another organ, such as the lungs. People with weakened immune systems who travel or live in areas where the fungi are common, are more susceptible to most causes of fungal arthritis. Conditions that can cause fungal arthritis include: - Blastomycosis - Candidiasis - Coccidioidomycosis - Cryptococcosis - Histoplasmosis - Sporotrichosis - Exserohilum rostratum (from injection with contaminated steroid vials)
-1.66666666667	what causes fungal pneumonia	Fungal arthritis: Fungal arthritis is swelling and irritation (inflammation) of a joint by a fungal infection. It is also called mycotic arthritis. Fungal arthritis is a rare condition. It can be caused by any of the invasive types of fungi. The infection can result from an infection in another organ, such as the lungs. People with weakened immune systems who travel or live in areas where the fungi are common, are more susceptible to most causes of fungal arthritis. Conditions that can cause fungal arthritis include: - Blastomycosis - Candidiasis - Coccidioidomycosis - Cryptococcosis - Histoplasmosis - Sporotrichosis - Exserohilum rostratum (from injection with contaminated steroid vials) The fungus can affect bone or joint tissue. One or more joints can be affected, most often the large, weight-bearing joints, such as the knees. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Fever - Joint pain - Joint stiffness - Joint swelling - Swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs Your health care provider will examine you. Tests that may be ordered include: - Culture of joint fluid that grows fungus - Joint x-ray showing joint changes - Positive antibody test (serology) for fungal disease - Synovial biopsy showing fungus The goal of treatment is to cure the infection using antifungal drugs. Commonly used antifungal drugs are amphotericin B or drugs in the azole family (fluconazole, ketoconazole, or itraconazole). Chronic or advanced bone or joint infection may require surgery (debridement) to remove the infected tissue. How well you do depends on the underlying cause of the infection and the your overall health. A weakened immune system, cancer, and certain medicines can affect the outcome. Joint damage may occur if the infection is not treated right away. Call for an appointment with your provider if you have any symptoms of fungal arthritis. Thorough treatment of fungal infections elsewhere in the body may help prevent fungal arthritis. Updated by: Jatin M.

-0.5	what does kidney disease look like	Who is at risk for Kidney Disease??: Diabetes and high blood pressure are the two leading risk factors for kidney disease. Both diabetes and high blood pressure damage the small blood vessels in your kidneys and can cause kidney disease -- without you feeling it. There are several other risk factors for kidney disease. Cardiovascular (heart) disease is a risk factor. So is family history: if you have a mother, father, sister, or brother who has had kidney disease, then you are at increased risk. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans tend to have a greater risk for kidney failure. This is mostly due to higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure in these communities, although there may be other reasons.

0.7	what does kidney disease look like	Diabetic Kidney Disease (What is diabetic kidney disease?): Diabetic kidney disease is a type of kidney disease caused by diabetes.Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. About 1 out of 4 adults with diabetes has kidney disease.1The main job of the kidneys is to filter wastes and extra water out of your blood to make urine. Your kidneys also help control blood pressure and make hormones that your body needs to stay healthy.Your kidneys are located in the middle of your back, just below your rib cage.When your kidneys are damaged, they can’t filter blood like they should, which can cause wastes to build up in your body. Kidney damage can also cause other health problems.Kidney damage caused by diabetes usually occurs slowly, over many years. You can take steps to protect your kidneys and to prevent or delay kidney damage.Watch a video about Diabetes and Kidney Disease.What are other names for diabetic kidney disease?Diabetic kidney disease is also called DKD, chronic kidney disease, CKD, kidney disease of diabetes, or diabetic nephropathy.

Early treatment may help protect your kidneys.
0.9	what does kidney disease look like	Polycystic kidney disease: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disorder in which clusters of cysts develop primarily within your kidneys, causing your kidneys to enlarge and lose function over time. Cysts are noncancerous round sacs containing fluid. The cysts vary in size, and they can grow very large. Having many cysts or large cysts can damage your kidneys. Polycystic kidney disease also can cause cysts to develop in your liver and elsewhere in your body. The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure. PKD varies greatly in its severity, and some complications are preventable. Lifestyle changes and treatments might help reduce damage to your kidneys from complications. Polycystic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Polycystic kidney disease symptoms can include: - High blood pressure - Back or side pain - Headache - A feeling of fullness in your abdomen - Increased size of your abdomen due to enlarged kidneys - Blood in your urine - Kidney stones - Kidney failure - Urinary tract or kidney infections It&aposs not uncommon for people to have polycystic kidney disease for years without knowing it. If you develop some of the signs and symptoms of polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor. If you have a first-degree relative - parent, sibling or child - with polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor to discuss screening for this disorder. Abnormal genes cause polycystic kidney disease, which means that in most cases, the disease runs in families. Rarely, a genetic mutation occurs on its own (spontaneous), so that neither parent has a copy of the mutated gene. The two main types of polycystic kidney disease, caused by different genetic flaws, are: - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Signs and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between the ages of 30 and 40. In the past, this type was called adult polycystic kidney disease, but children can develop the disorder. Only one parent needs to have the disease for it to pass to the children. If one parent has ADPKD, each child has a 50 percent chance of getting the disease. This form accounts for about 90 percent of cases of polycystic kidney disease. - Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). This type is far less common than is ADPKD. The signs and symptoms often appear shortly after birth. Sometimes, symptoms don&apost appear until later in childhood or during adolescence. Both parents must have abnormal genes to pass on this form of the disease. If both parents carry a gene for this disorder, each child has a 25 percent chance of getting the disease. Complications associated with polycystic kidney disease include: - High blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is a common complication of polycystic kidney disease. Untreated, high blood pressure can cause further damage to your kidneys and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. - Loss of kidney function. Progressive loss of kidney function is one of the most serious complications of polycystic kidney disease. Nearly half of those with the disease have kidney failure by age 60. PKD can interfere with the ability of your kidneys to keep wastes from building to toxic levels, a condition called uremia. As the disease worsens, end-stage kidney (renal) failure may result, necessitating ongoing kidney dialysis or a transplant to prolong your life. - Pregnancy complications. Pregnancy is successful for most women with polycystic kidney disease. In some cases, however, women may develop a life-threatening disorder called preeclampsia. Those most at risk have high blood pressure before they become pregnant. - Growth of cysts in the liver. The likelihood of developing liver cysts for someone with polycystic kidney disease increases with age. While both men and women develop cysts, women often develop larger cysts. Female hormones might contribute to cyst development. - Development of an aneurysm in the brain. A balloonlike bulge in a blood vessel (aneurysm) in your brain can cause bleeding (hemorrhage) if it ruptures. People with polycystic kidney disease have a higher risk of aneurysm. People with a family history of aneurysm seem to be at highest risk. - Heart valve abnormalities. As many as 1 in 4 adults with polycystic kidney disease develops mitral valve prolapse. When this happens, the valve no longer closes properly, which allows blood to leak backward. - Colon problems. Weaknesses and pouches or sacs in the wall of the colon (diverticulosis) may develop in people with polycystic kidney disease. - Chronic pain. Pain is a common symptom for people with polycystic kidney disease. It often occurs in your side or back. The pain can also be associated with a urinary tract infection, a kidney stone or a malignancy. For polycystic kidney disease, certain tests can detect the size and number of kidney cysts you have and evaluate the amount of healthy kidney tissue, including: - Ultrasound. During an ultrasound, a wandlike device called a transducer is placed on your body. It emits sound waves that are reflected back to the transducer - like sonar. A computer translates the reflected sound waves into images of your kidneys. - CT scan. As you lie on a movable table, you&aposre guided into a big, doughnut-shaped device that projects thin X-ray beams through your body. Your doctor is able to see cross-sectional images of your kidneys. - MRI scan. As you lie inside a large cylinder, magnetic fields and radio waves generate cross-sectional views of your kidneys. Treating polycystic kidney disease involves dealing with the following signs, symptoms and complications in their early stages: - High blood pressure. Controlling high blood pressure can delay the progression of the disease and slow further kidney damage. Combining a low-sodium, low-fat diet that&aposs moderate in protein and calorie content with not smoking, increasing exercise and reducing stress may help control high blood pressure. However, medications are usually needed to control high blood pressure. Medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used to control high blood pressure. - Pain. You might be able to control the pain of polycystic kidney disease with over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen. For some people, however, the pain is more severe and constant. In rare cases, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove cysts if they&aposre large enough to cause pressure and pain. - Bladder or kidney infections. Prompt treatment of infections with antibiotics is necessary to prevent kidney damage. - Blood in the urine. You&aposll need to drink lots of fluids, preferably plain water, as soon as you notice blood in your urine to dilute the urine. Dilution might help prevent obstructive clots from forming in your urinary tract. - Kidney failure. If your kidneys lose their ability to remove waste products and extra fluids from your blood, you&aposll eventually need either dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Aneurysms. If you have polycystic kidney disease and a family history of ruptured brain (intracranial) aneurysms, your doctor may recommend regular screening for intracranial aneurysms. If an aneurysm is discovered, surgical clipping of the aneurysm to reduce the risk of bleeding may be an option, depending on its size. Nonsurgical treatment of small aneurysms may involve controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, as well as quitting smoking.
1.0	what does kidney disease look like	Chronic kidney disease: Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue and weakness - Sleep problems - Changes in how much you urinate - Decreased mental sharpness - Muscle twitches and cramps - Swelling of feet and ankles - Persistent itching - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs - High blood pressure (hypertension) that&aposs difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney&aposs filtering units (glomeruli) - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney&aposs tubules and surrounding structures - Polycystic kidney disease - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Smoking - Obesity - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American - Family history of kidney disease - Abnormal kidney structure - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart&aposs ability to function and may be life-threatening - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures - Anemia - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you&aposve been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you&aposve taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you&aposve noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys&apos structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that&aposs inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what&aposs causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled. Treating complications Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments may include: - High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend medications to lower your blood pressure - commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers - and to preserve kidney function. High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you may need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor will likely also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet. - Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor may recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. - Medications to treat anemia. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron. Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia. - Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease may retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body. - Medications to protect your bones. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You may also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification). - A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet. Your doctor may recommend follow-up testing at regular intervals to see whether your kidney disease remains stable or progresses. Treatment for end-stage kidney disease If your kidneys can&apost keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood. In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube (catheter) inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a period of time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it. - Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors. You&aposll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don&apost need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant. For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat kidney failure with conservative measures. However, once you have complete kidney failure, your life expectancy generally would be only a few months. Potential future treatments Regenerative medicine holds the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that today are beyond repair. Regenerative medicine approaches include: - Boosting the body&aposs natural ability to heal itself - Using healthy cells, tissues or organs from a living or deceased donor to replace damaged ones - Delivering specific types of cells or cell products to diseased tissues or organs to restore tissue and organ function For people with chronic kidney disease, regenerative medicine approaches may be developed in the future to help slow progression of the disease. As part of your treatment for chronic kidney disease, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys. Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, your dietitian may recommend that you: - Avoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses. - Choose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods at each meal. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure. - Limit the amount of protein you eat. Your dietitian will estimate the appropriate number of grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals.
-0.7	what does kidney disease look like	Causes of Chronic Kidney Disease: Too much glucose, also called sugar, in your blood damages your kidneys’ filters. Over time, your kidneys can become so damaged that they no longer do a good job filtering wastes and extra fluid from your blood.Often, the first sign of kidney disease from diabetes is protein in your urine. When the filters are damaged, a protein called albumin, which you need to stay healthy, passes out of your blood and into your urine. A healthy kidney doesn’t let albumin pass from the blood into the urine.Diabetic kidney disease is the medical term for kidney disease caused by diabetes. High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the kidneys so they don’t work as well. If the blood vessels in your kidneys are damaged, your kidneys may not work as well to remove wastes and extra fluid from your body. Extra fluid in the blood vessels may then raise blood pressure even more, creating a dangerous cycle.More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, High Blood Pressure and Kidney Disease.High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in your kidneys. Other causes of kidney disease includea genetic disorder that causes many cysts to grow in the kidneys, polycystic kidney disease (PKD). an infection a drug that is toxic to the kidneys a disease that affects the entire body, such as diabetes or lupus. Lupus nephritis is the medical name for kidney disease caused by lupus IgA glomerulonephritis disorders in which the body’s immune system attacks its own cells and organs, such as Goodpasture syndrome heavy metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning rare genetic conditions, such as Alport syndrome hemolytic uremic syndrome in children Henoch-Schönlein purpura renal artery stenosis

Amyloidosis is a rare disease that occurs when amyloid proteins are deposited in tissues and organs. Amyloid proteins are abnormal proteins that the body cannot break down and recycle, as it does with normal proteins. When amyloid proteins clump together, they form amyloid deposits. The buildup of these deposits damages a person’s organs and tissues. Amyloidosis can affect different organs and tissues in different people and can affect more than one organ at the same time. Amyloidosis most frequently affects the kidneys, heart, nervous system, liver, and digestive tract. The symptoms and severity of amyloidosis depend on the organs and tissues affected. What are the kidneys and what do they do? The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men, the urethra is long, while in women it is short. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. What types of amyloidosis affect the kidneys? Primary amyloidosis and dialysis-related amyloidosis are the types of amyloidosis that can affect the kidneys. Primary Amyloidosis of the Kidneys The kidneys are the organs most commonly affected by primary amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits damage the kidneys and make it harder for them to filter wastes and break down proteins. When the kidneys become too damaged, they may no longer be able to function well enough to maintain health, resulting in kidney failure. Kidney failure can lead to problems such as high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemia—a condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. Dialysis-related Amyloidosis People who suffer from kidney failure and have been on long-term dialysis may develop dialysis-related amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis occurs when a certain protein, called beta-2 microglobulin, builds up in the blood because dialysis does not remove it completely. The two types of dialysis are hemodialysis. Hemodialysis uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes and extra fluid from the blood. peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal cavity—the space in the body that holds organs such as the stomach, intestines, and liver—to filter the blood. Dialysis-related amyloidosis is a complication of kidney failure because neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis effectively filters beta-2 microglobulin from the blood. As a result, elevated amounts of beta-2 microglobulin remain in the blood. Dialysis-related amyloidosis is relatively common in people with kidney failure, especially adults older than 60 years of age, who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years.1 More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics: Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis What are the signs and symptoms of primary amyloidosis of the kidneys? The most common sign of primary amyloidosis of the kidneys is nephrotic syndrome––a collection of signs that indicate kidney damage. The signs of nephrotic syndrome include albuminuria—an increased amount of albumin, a protein, in the urine. A person with nephrotic syndrome excretes more than half a teaspoon of albumin per day. hyperlipidemia—a condition in which a person’s blood has more-than-normal amounts of fats and cholesterol. edema—swelling, typically in a person’s legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face. hypoalbuminemia—a condition in which a person’s blood has less-than-normal amounts of albumin. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults. Other signs and symptoms of primary amyloidosis may include fatigue, or feeling tired shortness of breath low blood pressure numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in the hands or feet weight loss What are the symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis? The symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis may include pain, stiffness, and fluid in the joints. abnormal, fluid-containing sacs, called cysts, in some bones. carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by unusual buildup of amyloid proteins in the wrists. The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness or tingling, sometimes associated with muscle weakness, in the fingers and hands. Dialysis-related amyloidosis most often affects bones, joints, and the tissues that connect muscle to bone, called tendons. The disease may also affect the digestive tract and organs such as the heart and lungs. Bone cysts caused by dialysis-related amyloidosis can lead to bone fractures. Dialysis-related amyloidosis can also cause tears in tendons and ligaments. Ligaments are tissues that connect bones to other bones. How is primary amyloidosis of the kidneys diagnosed? A health care provider diagnoses primary amyloidosis of the kidneys with a medical and family history a physical exam urinalysis blood tests a kidney biopsy Medical and Family History Taking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose amyloidosis of the kidneys. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history. Physical Exam A physical exam may help diagnose primary amyloidosis of the kidneys. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patient’s body to check for swelling uses a stethoscope to listen to the lungs taps on specific areas of the patient’s body Urinalysis A health care provider may use urinalysis—the testing of a urine sample—to check for albumin and amyloid proteins in urine. The patient provides a urine sample in a special container at a health care provider’s office or a commercial facility. A nurse or technician can test the sample in the same location or send it to a lab for analysis. More-than-normal amounts of albumin in urine may indicate kidney damage due to primary amyloidosis. Amyloid proteins in urine may indicate amyloidosis. Blood Tests The health care provider may use blood tests to see how well the kidneys are working and to check for amyloid proteins and hyperlipidemia. A blood test involves drawing a patient’s blood at a health care provider’s office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests for kidney function measure the waste products in the blood that healthy kidneys normally filter out. Hyperlipidemia may indicate nephrotic syndrome. Amyloid proteins in blood may indicate amyloidosis. Kidney Biopsy Only a biopsy can show the amyloid protein deposits in the kidneys. A health care provider may recommend a kidney biopsy if other tests show kidney damage. A kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs a kidney biopsy in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney and take the tissue sample. A pathologist—a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases––examines the tissue in a lab for amyloid proteins and kidney damage. The biopsy results can help the health care provider determine the best course of treatment. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kidney Biopsy. How is dialysis-related amyloidosis diagnosed? A health care provider diagnoses dialysis-related amyloidosis with urinalysis blood tests imaging tests A health care provider can use urinalysis and blood tests to detect the amount of amyloid proteins in urine and blood. Imaging tests, such as x-rays and CT scans, can provide pictures of bone cysts and amyloid deposits in bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments. An x-ray technician performs imaging tests in a health care provider’s office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. A radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images. A patient does not require anesthesia. X-ray image showing amyloid deposits in the wrist How is primary amyloidosis of the kidneys treated? A health care provider treats primary amyloidosis of the kidneys with the following: medication therapy, including chemotherapy a stem cell transplant treating other conditions Medication therapy. The goal of medication therapy, including chemotherapy, is to reduce amyloid protein levels in the blood. Many health care providers recommend combination medication therapy such as melphalan (Alkeran), a type of chemotherapy dexamethasone (Decadron), an anti-inflammatory steroid medication These medications can stop the growth of the cells that make amyloid proteins. These medications may cause hair loss and serious side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure that replaces a patient’s damaged stem cells with healthy ones. Stem cells are found in the bone marrow and develop into three types of blood cells the body needs. To prepare for a stem cell transplant, the patient receives high doses of chemotherapy. The actual transplant is like a blood transfusion. The transplanted stem cells travel to the bone marrow to make healthy new blood cells. The chemotherapy a patient receives to prepare for the transplant can have serious side effects, so it is important to talk with the health care provider about the risks of this procedure. Read more in What Is a Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant? at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/bmsct. Treating other conditions. Primary amyloidosis has no cure, so treating some of the side effects and other conditions seen with the disease is essential. Other conditions may include anemia—treatment may include medications depression—treatment may include talking with a mental health counselor and taking medications fatigue—treatment may include changes in diet and activity level kidney disease—treatment may include medications to help maintain kidney function or slow the progression of kidney disease A patient and his or her family should talk with the health care provider about resources for support and treatment options. More information about kidney disease is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kidney Disease. How is dialysis-related amyloidosis treated? A health care provider treats dialysis-related amyloidosis with medication therapy newer, more effective hemodialysis filters surgery a kidney transplant The goal of medication therapy and the use of newer, more effective hemodialysis filters is to reduce amyloid protein levels in the blood. Medication therapy can help reduce symptoms such as pain and inflammation. A health care provider may treat a person with dialysis-related amyloidosis who has bone, joint, and tendon problems, such as bone cysts and carpal tunnel syndrome, using surgery. Dialysis-related amyloidosis has no cure; however, a successful kidney transplant may stop the disease from progressing. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Transplantation. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing primary amyloidosis of the kidneys or dialysis-related amyloidosis. People with nephrotic syndrome may make dietary changes such as limiting dietary sodium, often from salt, to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure decreasing liquid intake to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure eating a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol to help control more-than-normal amounts of fats and cholesterol in the blood Health care providers may recommend that people with kidney disease eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein. Proteins break down into waste products that the kidneys filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. People with kidney disease on a restricted protein diet should receive blood tests that can show low nutrient levels. People with primary amyloidosis of the kidneys or dialysis-related amyloidosis should talk with a health care provider about dietary restrictions to best manage their individual needs. Points to Remember Amyloidosis is a rare disease that occurs when amyloid proteins are deposited in tissues and organs. Primary amyloidosis and dialysis-related amyloidosis are the types of amyloidosis that can affect the kidneys. The most common sign of primary amyloidosis of the kidneys is nephrotic syndrome.

-0.375	what is acute diverticulitis	Diverticulitis (Symptoms): People with diverticulosis often have no symptoms, but they may have bloating and cramping in the lower part of the belly. Rarely, they may notice blood in their stool or on toilet paper. Symptoms of diverticulitis are more severe and often start suddenly, but they may become worse over a few days. They include: - Tenderness, usually in the left lower side of the abdomen - Bloating or gas - Fever and chills - Nausea and vomiting - Not feeling hungry and not eating
2.0	what is acute diverticulitis	What is Diverticulitis?: Diverticulitis occurs when small, bulging sacs or pouches that form on the inner wall of the intestine (diverticula) become inflamed or infected. Most often, these pouches are in the large intestine (colon).
0.75	what is acute diverticulitis	Diverticulitis (Diagnosis): Diverticulitis is usually diagnosed during an acute attack. Because abdominal pain can indicate a number of problems, your doctor will need to rule out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely start with a physical examination, including checking your abdomen for tenderness. Women, in addition, generally have a pelvic examination to rule out pelvic disease. After that, your doctor will likely recommend: - Blood and urine tests, to check for signs of infection. - Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age, to rule out pregnancy as a cause of abdominal pain. - Liver function tests, to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. - Stool test, to rule out infection in people who have diarrhea. - CT scan, which can indicate inflamed or infected pouches and confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis. CT can also indicate the severity of diverticulitis and guide treatment. Diagnosis at Mayo Clinic Diverticulitis can be difficult to diagnose because abdominal pain is a symptom of many digestive disorders. Mayo Clinic has radiologists who specialize in digestive disorders and have experience distinguishing diverticulitis from other conditions. Mayo&aposs digestive disease specialists (gastroenterologists) have experience diagnosing the severity of diverticulitis. Precise diagnosis is important for appropriate treatment.
0.875	what is acute diverticulitis	Diverticulitis: Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system. They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common, especially after age 40, and seldom cause problems. Sometimes, however, one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected. That condition is known as diverticulitis (die-vur-tik-yoo-LIE-tis). Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in your bowel habits. Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics. Severe or recurring diverticulitis may require surgery. The signs and symptoms of diverticulitis include: - Pain, which may be constant and persist for several days. Pain is usually felt in the lower left side of the abdomen, but may occur on the right, especially in people of Asian descent. - Nausea and vomiting. - Fever. - Abdominal tenderness. - Constipation or, less commonly, diarrhea. Diverticula usually develop when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure. This causes marble-sized pouches to protrude through the colon wall. Diverticulitis occurs when diverticula tear, resulting in inflammation or infection or both. Several factors may increase your risk of developing diverticulitis: - Aging. The incidence of diverticulitis increases with age. - Obesity. Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulitis. Morbid obesity may increase your risk of needing more-invasive treatments for diverticulitis. - Smoking. People who smoke cigarettes are more likely than nonsmokers to experience diverticulitis. - Lack of exercise. Vigorous exercise appears to lower your risk of diverticulitis. - Diet high in animal fat and low in fiber, although the role of low fiber alone isn&apost clear. - Certain medications. Several drugs are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis, including steroids, opiates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Diverticulitis is usually diagnosed during an acute attack. Because abdominal pain can indicate a number of problems, your doctor will need to rule out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely start with a physical examination, including checking your abdomen for tenderness. Women, in addition, generally have a pelvic examination to rule out pelvic disease. After that, your doctor will likely recommend: - Blood and urine tests, to check for signs of infection. - Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age, to rule out pregnancy as a cause of abdominal pain. - Liver function tests, to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. - Stool test, to rule out infection in people who have diarrhea. - CT scan, which can indicate inflamed or infected pouches and confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis. CT can also indicate the severity of diverticulitis and guide treatment. Diagnosis at Mayo Clinic Diverticulitis can be difficult to diagnose because abdominal pain is a symptom of many digestive disorders. Mayo Clinic has radiologists who specialize in digestive disorders and have experience distinguishing diverticulitis from other conditions. Mayo&aposs digestive disease specialists (gastroenterologists) have experience diagnosing the severity of diverticulitis. Precise diagnosis is important for appropriate treatment. Treatment depends on the severity of your signs and symptoms. Uncomplicated diverticulitis If your symptoms are mild, you may be treated at home. Your doctor is likely to recommend: - Antibiotics, to treat infection. - A liquid diet for a few days while your bowel heals. Once your symptoms improve, you can gradually add solid food to your diet. - An over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). This treatment is successful in 70 to 100 percent of people with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Complicated diverticulitis If you have a severe attack or have other health problems, you&aposll likely need to be hospitalized. Treatment generally involves: - Intravenous antibiotics - Insertion of a tube to drain an abscess, if one has formed Surgery You&aposll likely need surgery to treat diverticulitis if: - You have a complication, such as perforation, abscess, fistula or bowel obstruction - You have had multiple episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis - You are immune compromised There are two main types of surgery: - Primary bowel resection. The surgeon removes diseased segments of your intestine and then reconnects the healthy segments (anastomosis). This allows you to have normal bowel movements. Depending on the amount of inflammation, you may have open surgery or a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. - Bowel resection with colostomy. If you have so much inflammation that it&aposs not possible to rejoin your colon and rectum, the surgeon will perform a colostomy. An opening (stoma) in your abdominal wall is connected to the healthy part of your colon. Waste passes through the opening into a bag. Once the inflammation has eased, the colostomy may be reversed and the bowel reconnected. Follow-up care Your doctor may recommend colonoscopy six weeks after you recover from diverticulitis, especially if you haven&apost had the test in the previous year. There doesn&apost appear to be a direct link between diverticular disease and colon or rectal cancer. But colonoscopy - which isn&apost possible during a diverticulitis attack - can exclude colon cancer as a cause of your symptoms. Sometimes, surgery is recommended. But previous recommendations for surgery based on the number of attacks have been questioned, since most people do well even after two or more attacks. The decision on surgery is an individual one, and is often based on the frequency of attacks and whether complications have occurred. Treatment at Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic specialists have experience treating both mild and severe diverticulitis. If you need surgery, Mayo surgeons can offer minimally invasive options - including laparoscopic, hand-assisted laparoscopic and robotic procedures - if appropriate. To help prevent diverticulitis: - Exercise regularly. Exercise promotes normal bowel function and reduces pressure inside your colon. Try to exercise at least 30 minutes on most days. - Eat more fiber. High-fiber foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, soften waste material and help it pass more quickly through your colon. This reduces pressure inside your digestive tract. However, it isn&apost clear whether a high-fiber diet decreases the risk of diverticulitis. Eating seeds and nuts isn&apost associated with developing diverticulitis. - Drink plenty of fluids. Fiber works by absorbing water and increasing the soft, bulky waste in your colon. But if you don&apost drink enough liquid to replace what&aposs absorbed, fiber can be constipating. Some experts suspect that people who develop diverticulitis may not have enough good bacteria in their colons. Probiotics - foods or supplements that contain beneficial bacteria - are sometimes suggested as a way to prevent diverticulitis. But that advice hasn&apost been scientifically validated.
-1.625	what is acute diverticulitis	Acute sinusitis: Acute sinusitis (acute rhinosinusitis) causes the cavities around your nasal passages (sinuses) to become inflamed and swollen. This interferes with drainage and causes mucus to build up. With acute sinusitis, it might be difficult to breathe through your nose. The area around your eyes and face might feel swollen, and you might have throbbing facial pain or a headache. Acute sinusitis is mostly caused by the common cold. Unless a bacterial infection develops, most cases resolve within a week to 10 days. In most cases, home remedies are all that&aposs needed to treat acute sinusitis. However, persistent sinusitis can lead to serious infections and other complications. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks despite medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis. Acute sinusitis symptoms often include: - Drainage of a thick, yellow or greenish discharge from the nose or down the back of the throat (postnasal drainage) - Nasal obstruction or congestion, causing difficulty breathing through your nose - Pain, tenderness, swelling and pressure around your eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead that worsens when bending over Other signs and symptoms can include: - Ear pressure - Headache - Aching in your upper jaw and teeth - Reduced sense of smell and taste - Cough, which might be worse at night - Bad breath (halitosis) - Fatigue - Fever When to see a doctor Most people with acute sinusitis don&apost need to see a doctor. Contact your doctor if you have any of the following: - Symptoms that either don&apost improve within a few days or worsen - A persistent fever - A history of recurrent or chronic sinusitis Acute sinusitis is most often caused by the common cold, which is a viral infection. In some cases, a bacterial infection develops. You may be at increased risk of getting sinusitis if you have: - Hay fever or another allergic condition that affects your sinuses - A nasal passage abnormality, such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors - A medical condition such as cystic fibrosis or an immune system disorder such as HIV/AIDS Acute sinusitis complications are uncommon. If they occur, they might include: - Chronic sinusitis. Acute sinusitis may be a flare-up of a long-term problem known as chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks. - Meningitis. This infection causes inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord. - Other infections. Uncommonly, infection can spread to the bones (osteomyelitis) or skin (cellulitis). - Partial or complete loss of sense of smell. Nasal obstruction and inflammation of the nerve for smell (olfactory nerve) can cause temporary or permanent loss of smell. - Vision problems. If infection spreads to your eye socket, it can cause reduced vision or even blindness that can be permanent. Your doctor will feel for tenderness in your nose and face and look inside your nose. Other methods that might be used to diagnose acute sinusitis and rule out other conditions include: - Nasal endoscopy. A thin, flexible tube (endoscope) with a fiber-optic light inserted through your nose allows your doctor to visually inspect the inside of your sinuses. - Imaging studies. A CT scan or MRI can show details of your sinuses and nasal area. While not recommended for uncomplicated acute sinusitis, imaging studies might help identify abnormalities or suspected complications. - Nasal and sinus cultures. Laboratory tests are generally unnecessary for diagnosing acute sinusitis. However, when the condition fails to respond to treatment or is worsening, tissue cultures might help determine the cause, such as a bacterial infection. - Allergy testing. If your doctor suspects that allergies have triggered your acute sinusitis, he or she will recommend an allergy skin test. A skin test is safe and quick, and can help pinpoint the allergen that&aposs responsible for your nasal flare-ups. Most cases of acute sinusitis, those caused by a viral infection, resolve on their own. Self-care techniques are usually all you need to ease symptoms. Treatments to relieve symptoms Your doctor may recommend treatments to help relieve sinusitis symptoms, including: - Saline nasal spray, which you spray into your nose several times a day to rinse your nasal passages. - Nasal corticosteroids. These nasal sprays help prevent and treat inflammation. Examples include fluticasone (Flonase, Veramyst), budesonide (Rhinocort), mometasone (Nasonex) and beclomethasone (Beconase AQ, Qnasl, others). - Decongestants. These medications are available in over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription liquids, tablets and nasal sprays. Use nasal decongestants for only a few days. Otherwise they may cause the return of more severe congestion (rebound congestion). - OTC pain relievers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye&aposs syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Antibiotics Antibiotics usually aren&apost needed to treat acute sinusitis. Even if your acute sinusitis is bacterial, it may clear up without treatment. Your doctor might wait and watch to see if your bacterial acute sinusitis worsens. However, severe, progressive or persistent symptoms might require antibiotics. If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, be sure to take the whole course, even after your symptoms get better. If you stop taking them early, your symptoms may recur. Immunotherapy If allergies are contributing to your sinusitis, allergy shots (immunotherapy) that help reduce the body&aposs reaction to specific allergens may help treat your symptoms. These self-help steps can help relieve sinusitis symptoms: - Rest. This will help your body fight infection and speed recovery. - Drink fluids, such as water or juice. This will help dilute mucous secretions and promote drainage. Avoid beverages that contain caffeine or alcohol, as they can be dehydrating. Drinking alcohol can also worsen the swelling of the lining of the sinuses and nose. - Moisten your sinus cavities. Drape a towel over your head as you breathe in the vapor from a bowl of hot water. Keep the vapor directed toward your face. Or take a hot shower, breathing in the warm, moist air. This will help ease pain and help mucus drain. - Apply warm compresses to your face. Place warm, damp towels around your nose, cheeks and eyes to ease facial pain. - Rinse your nasal passages. Use a specially designed squeeze bottle (Sinus Rinse, others) or neti pot. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help clear your sinuses. If you make your own rinse, use water that&aposs contaminant-free - distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller - to make up the irrigation solution. Also be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with contaminant-free water and leave open to air-dry. - Sleep with your head elevated. This will help your sinuses drain, reducing congestion. No alternative therapies have been proved to ease the symptoms of acute sinusitis, but products containing certain combinations of herbs may help.

-1.75	what is acute diverticulitis	Acute nephritic syndrome: Acute nephritic syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur with some disorders that cause swelling and inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidney, or glomerulonephritis. Acute nephritic syndrome is often caused by an immune response triggered by an infection or other disease. Common causes in children and adolescents include: - Hemolytic uremic syndrome - Henoch-Schönlein purpura - IgA nephropathy - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis Common causes in adults include: - Abdominal abscesses - Goodpasture syndrome - Hepatitis B or C - Infective endocarditis - Membranoproliferative GN I - Membranoproliferative GN II - Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis - SLE or lupus nephritis - Vasculitis - Viral diseases such as mononucleosis, measles, mumps The inflammation affects the function of the glomerulus. This is the part of the kidney that filters blood to make urine and remove waste. As a result, blood and protein appear in the urine, and excess fluid builds up in the body. Swelling of the body occurs when the blood loses a protein called albumin. Albumin keeps fluid in the blood vessels. When it is lost, fluid collects in the body tissues. Blood loss from the damaged kidney structures leads to blood in the urine. Common symptoms of nephritic syndrome are: - Blood in the urine (urine appears dark, tea-colored, or cloudy) - Decreased urine output (little or no urine may be produced) - Swelling of the face, eye socket, legs, arms, hands, feet, abdomen, or other areas - High blood pressure Other symptoms that may occur include: - Blurred vision, usually from burst blood vessels in the retina of the eye - Cough containing mucus or pink, frothy material from fluid buildup in the lungs - Shortness of breath, from fluid buildup in the lungs - General ill feeling (malaise), drowsiness, confusion, aches and pains, headache Symptoms of acute kidney failure or chronic kidney disease may develop. During an examination, your health care provider may find the following signs: - High blood pressure - Abnormal heart and lung sounds - Signs of excess fluid (edema) such as swelling in the legs, arms, face, and belly - Enlarged liver - Enlarged veins in the neck Tests that may be done include: - Blood electrolytes - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) - Creatinine - blood - Creatinine clearance - Potassium test - Protein in the urine - Urinalysis - Urine appearance and color A kidney biopsy will show inflammation of the glomeruli, which may indicate the cause of the condition. Tests to find the cause of acute nephritic syndrome may include: - ANA titer (lupus) - Antiglomerular basement membrane antibody - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody for vasculitis (ANCA) - Blood culture - Culture of the throat or skin - Serum complement (C3 and C4) The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation in the kidney and control high blood pressure. You may need to stay in a hospital to be diagnosed and treated. Your provider may recommend: - Bedrest until you feel better with treatment - A diet that limits salt, fluids, and potassium - Medicines to control high blood pressure, reduce inflammation, or to remove fluid from your body - Kidney dialysis, if needed You can often ease the stress of illness by joining support groups where members share common experiences and problems. The outlook depends on the disease that is causing the nephritis. When the condition improves, symptoms of fluid retention (such as swelling and cough) and high blood pressure may go away in 1 or 2 weeks. Urine tests may take months to return to normal. Children tend to do better than adults and usually recover completely. Only rarely do they develop complications or progress to chronic glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease. Adults do not recover as well or as quickly as children. Although it is unusual for the disease to return, in some adults, the disease does return and they will develop end-stage kidney disease and may need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Call your provider if you have symptoms of acute nephritic syndrome. Often, the disorder cannot be prevented, although treatment of illness and infection may help to reduce the risk.

-1.875	what is acute diverticulitis	Gout: Gout is a type of arthritis. It occurs when uric acid builds up in blood and causes inflammation in the joints. Acute gout is a painful condition that often affects only one joint. Chronic gout is the repeated episodes of pain and inflammation. More than one joint may be affected. Watch this video about: Gout Gout is caused by having higher-than-normal level of uric acid in your body. This may occur if: - Your body makes too much uric acid - Your body has a hard time getting rid of uric acid If too much uric acid builds up in the fluid around the joints (synovial fluid), uric acid crystals form. These crystals cause the joint to swell and become inflamed. The exact cause is unknown. Gout may run in families. The problem is more common in men, in women after menopause, and people who drink alcohol. As people become older, gout becomes more common. The condition may also develop in people with: - Diabetes - Kidney disease - Obesity - Sickle cell anemia and other anemias - Leukemia and other blood cancers Gout may occur after taking medicines that interfere with the removal of uric acid from the body. People who take certain medicines, such as hydrochlorothiazide and other water pills, may have a higher level of uric acid in the blood. Symptoms of acute gout: - Only one or a few joints are affected. The big toe, knee, or ankle joints are most often affected. - The pain starts suddenly, often during the night. Pain is often described as throbbing, crushing, or excruciating. - The joint appears warm and red. It is usually very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it). - There may be a fever. - The attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time. Additional attacks often last longer. People will have no symptoms after a first gout attack. Many people will have another attack in the next 6 to12 months. Some people may develop chronic gout. This is also called gouty arthritis. This condition can lead to joint damage and loss of motion in the joints. People with chronic gout will have joint pain and other symptoms most of the time. Tophi are lumps below the skin around joints or other places such as the elbows, fingertips, and ears. Tophi can develop after a person has had gout for many years. These lumps may drain chalky material. Tests that may be done include: - Synovial fluid analysis (shows uric acid crystals) - Uric acid -- blood - Joint x-rays (may be normal) - Synovial biopsy - Uric acid -- urine A uric acid level in the blood over 7 mg/dL is high. But, not everyone with a high uric acid level has gout. Take medicines for gout as soon as you can if you have a sudden attack. Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or indomethacin when symptoms begin. Talk to your health care provider about the correct dose. You will need stronger doses for a few days. - Your provider may prescribe strong painkillers such as codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone. - A prescription medicine called colchicine helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. - Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) can also be very effective. Your provider may inject the inflamed joint with steroids to relieve the pain. - The pain often goes away within 12 hours of starting treatment. Most of the time, all pain is gone within 48 hours. You may need to take daily medicines such as allopurinol (Zyloprim), febuxostat (Uloric) or probenecid (Benemid) to decrease the uric acid level in your blood. You may need these medicines if: - You have several attacks during the same year or your attacks are quite severe. - You have damage to joints. - You have tophi. - You have kidney disease or uric acid kidney stones. Diet and lifestyle changes may help prevent gouty attacks: - Decrease alcohol, especially beer (some wine may be helpful). - Lose weight. - Exercise daily. - Limit your intake of red meat and sugary beverages. - Choose healthy foods, such as dairy products, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fruits (less sugary ones), and whole grains. - Drink coffee and take vitamin C supplements (may help some people). Proper treatment of acute attacks and lowering uric acid to a level less than 6 mg/dL allows people to live a normal life. However, the acute form of the disease may progress to chronic gout if not treated. Complications may include: - Chronic gouty arthritis - Kidney stones - Deposits in the kidneys, leading to chronic kidney failure Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of acute gouty arthritis. You may not be able to prevent gout, but you may be able to avoid things that trigger symptoms. Taking medicines to lower uric acid can prevent progression of gout. Updated by: Gordon A.

2.0	what is binge eating disorder	Binge eating disorder: Binge eating disorder is the most common type of eating disorder in the United States. People with binge eating disorder often feel out of control and eat a large amount of food at one time (called a binge). Unlike other eating disorders, people who have binge eating disorder do not throw up the food or exercise too much. Binge eating disorder is a serious health problem, but people with binge eating disorder can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise. According to the American Psychiatric Association, women with binge eating disorder feel out of control and eat too much (binge), at least once a week for at least three months. During binges women with binge eating disorder usually eat faster than normal, eat until they are uncomfortable, eat when they are not physically hungry, and feel embarrassed, disgusted, or depressed because of the binges. Women with this type of eating disorder may be overweight or obese. Women with eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health. Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia, people with binge eating disorder do not throw up their food, exercise a lot, or starve themselves. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese. But not all people with binge eating disorder are overweight, and being overweight does not always mean you have binge eating disorder. It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder affects more than 3% of women in the United States. More than half of people with binge eating disorder are women.1 Binge eating disorder affects women of all races and ethnicities. It is the most common eating disorder among Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American women.2,3,4 Some women may be more at risk for binge eating disorder. It can be difficult to tell whether someone has binge eating disorder. Many women with binge eating disorder hide their behavior because they are embarrassed. You may have binge eating disorder if, for at least once a week over the past three months, you have binged. Binge eating disorder means you have at least three of these symptoms while binging:8 People with binge eating disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Researchers are not sure exactly what causes binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person&aposs biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person&aposs biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses. Studies suggest that people with binge eating disorder may use overeating as a way to deal with anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety, or stress.9,10 Researchers are studying how changing levels of brain chemicals may affect eating habits. Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11 Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12 People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman&aposs everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following: Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder. Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control. Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for: Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16 After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.

2.0	what is copd	COPD: Español   Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants—such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts—also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions—emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.
1.72727272727	what is copd	What is COPD?: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it hard to breathe. You may also have heard COPD called other names, like emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people who have COPD, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partially blocked, making it difficult to get air in and out. COPD is a major cause of death and illness throughout the world. It kills more than 120,000 Americans each year. That&aposs one death every 4 minutes. How COPD Affects Airways The "airways" are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs through the nose and mouth. The airways of the lungs branch out like an upside-down tree. At the end of each branch are many small, balloon-like air sacs. In healthy people, the airways and air sacs are elastic (stretchy). When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon, and when you breathe out, the balloon deflates and the air goes out. In people with COPD, the airways and air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. Less air gets in and less air goes out of the airways because - The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band. - The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. - The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen. - Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen. Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. COPD Develops Slowly, Has No Cure When COPD is severe, shortness of breath and other symptoms of COPD can get in the way of even the most basic tasks, such as doing light housework, taking a walk, even washing and dressing. COPD develops slowly, and it may be many years before you notice symptoms like feeling short of breath. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older people. There is no cure for COPD. The damage to your airways and lungs cannot be reversed, but there are things you can do to control the disabling effects of the disease. COPD is not contagious. You cannot catch it from someone else.
1.90909090909	what is copd	What is COPD?: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it harder to breathe. With COPD, airways become blocked, making it harder to get air in and out.
1.63636363636	what is copd	COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. It&aposs caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. People with COPD are at increased risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer and a variety of other conditions. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. It&aposs characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter. COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can achieve good symptom control and quality of life, as well as reduced risk of other associated conditions. COPD care at Mayo Clinic COPD symptoms often don&apost appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if smoking exposure continues. For chronic bronchitis, the main symptom is a daily cough and mucus (sputum) production at least three months a year for two consecutive years. Other signs and symptoms of COPD may include: - Shortness of breath, especially during physical activities - Wheezing - Chest tightness - Having to clear your throat first thing in the morning, due to excess mucus in your lungs - A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish - Blueness of the lips or fingernail beds (cyanosis) - Frequent respiratory infections - Lack of energy - Unintended weight loss (in later stages) - Swelling in ankles, feet or legs People with COPD are also likely to experience episodes called exacerbations, during which their symptoms become worse than usual day-to-day variation and persist for at least several days. The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking. In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes. Only about 20 to 30 percent of chronic smokers may develop clinically apparent COPD, although many smokers with long smoking histories may develop reduced lung function. Some smokers develop less common lung conditions. They may be misdiagnosed as having COPD until a more thorough evaluation is performed. Air travels down your windpipe (trachea) and into your lungs through two large tubes (bronchi). Inside your lungs, these tubes divide many times - like the branches of a tree - into many smaller tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of tiny air sacs (alveoli). The air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). The oxygen in the air you inhale passes into these blood vessels and enters your bloodstream. At the same time, carbon dioxide - a gas that is a waste product of metabolism - is exhaled. Your lungs rely on the natural elasticity of the bronchial tubes and air sacs to force air out of your body. COPD causes them to lose their elasticity and overexpand, which leaves some air trapped in your lungs when you exhale. Causes of airway obstruction include: - Emphysema. This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. Small airways collapse when you exhale, impairing airflow out of your lungs. - Chronic bronchitis. In this condition, your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed and your lungs produce more mucus, which can further block the narrowed tubes. You develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways. In the vast majority of cases, the lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term cigarette smoking. But there are likely other factors at play in the development of COPD, such as a genetic susceptibility to the disease, because only about 20 to 30 percent of smokers may develop COPD. Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. In about 1 percent of people with COPD, the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) is made in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can affect the liver as well as the lungs. Damage to the lung can occur in infants and children, not only adults with long smoking histories. For adults with COPD related to AAt deficiency, treatment options include those used for people with more-common types of COPD. In addition, some people can be treated by replacing the missing AAt protein, which may prevent further damage to the lungs. Risk factors for COPD include: - Exposure to tobacco smoke. The most significant risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking. The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk, as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke. - People with asthma who smoke. The combination of asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, and smoking increases the risk of COPD even more. - Occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs. - Exposure to fumes from burning fuel. In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing COPD. - Age. COPD develops slowly over years, so most people are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin. - Genetics. The uncommon genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the cause of some cases of COPD. Other genetic factors likely make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease. COPD can cause many complications, including: - Respiratory infections. People with COPD are more likely to catch colds, the flu and pneumonia. Any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and could cause further damage to lung tissue. An annual flu vaccination and regular vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia can prevent some infections. - Heart problems. For reasons that aren&apost fully understood, COPD can increase your risk of heart disease, including heart attack. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk. - Lung cancer. People with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk. - High blood pressure in lung arteries. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Depression. Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. And dealing with serious illness can contribute to development of depression. Talk to your doctor if you feel sad or helpless or think that you may be experiencing depression. COPD is commonly misdiagnosed - former smokers may sometimes be told they have COPD, when in reality they may have simple deconditioning or another less common lung condition. Likewise, many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced and interventions are less effective. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you&aposve had to lung irritants - especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition. Tests may include: - Lung (pulmonary) function tests. Pulmonary function tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and if your lungs are delivering enough oxygen to your blood. Spirometry is the most common lung function test. During this test, you&aposll be asked to blow into a large tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. This machine measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD even before you have symptoms of the disease. It can also be used to track the progression of disease and to monitor how well treatment is working. Spirometry often includes measurement of the effect of bronchodilator administration. Other lung function tests include measurement of lung volumes, diffusing capacity and pulse oximetry. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure. - CT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer. - Arterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide. - Laboratory tests. Laboratory tests aren&apost used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, laboratory tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) deficiency, which may be the cause of some cases of COPD. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age, such as under age 45. A diagnosis of COPD is not the end of the world. Most people have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life. Smoking cessation The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It&aposs the only way to keep COPD from getting worse - which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn&apost easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you&aposve tried to quit and have been unsuccessful. Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. It&aposs also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible. Medications Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. These medications - which usually come in an inhaler - relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both. Short-acting bronchodilators include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA), and ipratropium (Atrovent). The long-acting bronchodilators include tiotropium (Spiriva), salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta) and aclidinium (Tudorza). Inhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Fluticasone (Flovent HFA, Flonase, others) and budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Uceris, others) are examples of inhaled steroids. Some medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination inhalers. For people who have a moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection. A new type of medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss. This very inexpensive medication may help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor. Side effects are dose related, and low doses are recommended. Respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat acute exacerbations, but they aren&apost generally recommended for prevention. However, a recent study shows that the antibiotic azithromycin prevents exacerbations, but it isn&apost clear whether this is due to its antibiotic effect or its anti-inflammatory properties. Lung therapies Doctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD: - Oxygen therapy. If there isn&apost enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town. Some people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options. - Pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You&aposll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs. Pulmonary rehabilitation may shorten hospitalizations, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program. Managing exacerbations Even with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don&apost receive prompt treatment. Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it&aposs important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing, a change in your mucus or if you have a harder time breathing. When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor will talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking, taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications, getting your annual flu vaccine, and avoiding air pollution whenever possible. Surgery Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren&apost helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include: - Lung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival. - Lung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it&aposs a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and it&aposs necessary to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications. - Bullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow. If you have COPD, you can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to your lungs: - Control your breathing. Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions and relaxation techniques that you can use when you&aposre short of breath. - Clear your airways. With COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help. - Exercise regularly. It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your doctor which activities are appropriate for you. - Eat healthy foods. A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you&aposre underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you&aposre overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion. - Avoid smoke and air pollution. In addition to quitting smoking, it&aposs important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs. - See your doctor regularly. Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you&aposre feeling fine. It&aposs important to steadily monitor your lung function. And be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD. Ask your doctor when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. Let your doctor know if you have worsening symptoms or you notice signs of infection.

-0.454545454545	what is copd	Smoking and COPD: Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Smoking is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages the air sacs, airways, and the lining of your lungs. Injured lungs have trouble moving enough air in and out, so it&aposs hard to breathe. Things that make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms worse are called triggers. Knowing what your triggers are and how to avoid them can help you feel better. Smoking is a trigger for many people who have COPD. Smoking can cause an exacerbation, or flare-up, of your symptoms. You do not have to be a smoker for smoking to cause harm. Exposure to someone else&aposs smoking (called secondhand smoke) is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages your lungs. When you have COPD and smoke, your lungs will get damaged more rapidly than if you were to stop smoking. Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do to protect your lungs and keep your COPD symptoms from getting worse. This can help you stay more active and enjoy life. Tell your friends and family about your goal to quit. Take a break from people and situations that make you want to smoke. Keep busy with other things. Take it 1 day at a time. Ask your health care provider to help you quit. There are many ways to quit smoking, including: - Medicines - Nicotine replacement therapy - Support groups, counseling, or stop-smoking classes in person or online It is not easy, but anyone can quit. Newer medicines and programs can be very helpful. List the reasons you want to quit. Then set a quit date. You may need to try quitting more than once. And that&aposs OK. Keep trying if you do not succeed at first. The more times you try to quit, the more likely you are to be successful. Secondhand smoke will trigger more COPD flare-ups and cause more damage to your lungs. So you need to take steps to avoid secondhand smoke. - Make your home and car smoke-free zones. Tell others you are with to follow this rule. Take ashtrays out of your home. - Choose smoke-free restaurants, bars, and workplaces (if possible). - Avoid public places that allow smoking. Setting these rules can: - Reduce the amount of secondhand smoke you and your family breathe in - Help you quit smoking and stay smoke-free If there are smokers at your workplace, ask someone about policies regarding if and where smoking is allowed. Tips to help with secondhand smoke at work are: - Make sure there are proper containers for smokers to throw away their cigarette butts and matches. - Ask coworkers who smoke to keep their coats away from work areas. - Use a fan and keep windows open, if possible. - Use an alternative exit to avoid smokers outside the building.

1.81818181818	what is copd	What is COPD?: COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main cause of COPD is long-term exposure to substances that irritate and damage the lungs. This is usually cigarette smoke. Air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause it. At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. They include - A cough that produces a lot of mucus - Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity - Wheezing - Chest tightness Doctors use lung function tests, imaging tests, and blood tests to diagnose COPD. There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms. They include medicines, oxygen therapy, surgery, or a lung transplant. Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.

-0.545454545455	what is copd	COPD and other health problems: If you have COPD, you are more likely to have other health problems, too. These are called comorbidities. People with COPD tend to have more health problems than people who do not have COPD. Having other health problems can affect your symptoms and treatments. You may need to visit your doctor more often. You also may need to have more tests or treatments. Having COPD is a lot to manage. But try to stay positive. You can protect your health by understanding why you are at risk for certain conditions and learning how to prevent them. If you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), you are more likely to have: - Repeat infections, such as pneumonia. COPD increases your risk of complications from colds and the flu. It increases your risk of needing to be hospitalized due to lung infection. - High blood pressure in the lungs. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. - Heart disease. COPD increases your risk of heart attack, heart failure, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and blood clots. - Diabetes. Having COPD increases this risk. Also, some COPD medicines can cause high blood sugar. - Osteoporosis (weak bones). People with COPD often have low levels of vitamin D, are inactive, and smoke. These factors increase your risk of bone loss and weak bones. Certain COPD medicines also may cause bone loss. - Depression and anxiety. It is common for people with COPD to feel depressed or anxious. Being breathless can cause anxiety. Plus, having symptoms slows you down so you can&apost do as much as you used to. - Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and heartburn can lead to more COPD symptoms and flare-ups. - Lung cancer. Continuing to smoke increases this risk. Many factors play a role in why people with COPD often have other health problems. Smoking is one of the biggest culprits. Smoking is a risk factor for most of the problems above. - COPD usually develops in middle age. And people tend to have more health problems as they age. - COPD makes it hard to breathe, which can make it hard to get enough exercise. Being inactive can lead to bone and muscle loss and increase your risk for other health problems. - Certain COPD medicines can increase your risk of other conditions such as bone loss, heart conditions, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Work closely with your doctor to keep COPD and other medical problems under control. Taking the following steps can also help protect your health: - Take medicines and treatments as directed. - If you smoke, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your doctor about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine replacement therapy and tobacco cessation medicines. - Discuss the risks and side effects of your medicines with your doctor. There may be better options available or things you can do to reduce or offset the harms. Tell your doctor if you notice any side effects. - Have a yearly flu vaccine and a pneumonia vaccine to help guard against infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from people with colds or other infections. - Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight training. Talk with your doctor about ways to get exercise. - Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating several small healthy meals a day can give you the nutrients you need without feeling bloated. An overfull belly can make it hard to breathe. - Talk with your doctor if you feel sad, helpless, or worried. There are programs and medicines that can help you feel more positive and hopeful. Remember that you are not alone. Your doctor will work with you to help you stay as healthy and active as possible. You should call your doctor when: - You have new signs or symptoms that concern you. - You are having trouble managing one or more of your health conditions. - You have concerns about your health problems and treatments. - You feel hopeless, sad, or anxious. - You notice medicine side effects that bother you.

All of these factors can make you feel stressed, anxious, or depressed.
-0.909090909091	what is copd	COPD - how to use a nebulizer: A nebulizer turns your COPD medicine into a mist. It is easier to breathe the medicine into your lungs this way. If you use a nebulizer, your COPD medicines will come in liquid form. With a nebulizer, you will sit with your machine and use a mouthpiece. Medicine goes into your lungs as you take slow, deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes. Many people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not need to use a nebulizer. Another way to get your medicine is with an inhaler, which is usually just as effective. Nebulizers can deliver medicine with less effort than inhalers. You and your doctor can decide if a nebulizer is the best way to get the medicine you need. The choice of device may be based on whether you find a nebulizer easier to use and what type of medicine you take. Most nebulizers use air compressors. Some use sound vibrations. These are called "ultrasonic nebulizers." They are quieter, but they cost more. Follow these steps to set up and use your nebulizer: - Connect the hose to the air compressor. - Fill the medicine cup with your prescription. To avoid spills, close the medicine cup tightly and always hold the mouthpiece straight up and down. - Attach the other end of the hose to the mouthpiece and medicine cup. - Turn on the nebulizer machine. - Place the mouthpiece in your mouth. Keep your lips firm around the mouthpiece so that all of the medicine goes into your lungs. - Breathe through your mouth until all the medicine is used. This usually takes 10 to 15 minutes. Some people use a nose clip to help them breathe only through their mouth. - Turn off the machine when you are done. You will need to clean your nebulizer to prevent bacteria from growing in it, since bacteria can cause a lung infection. It takes some time to clean your nebulizer and keep it working properly. Be sure to unplug the machine before cleaning. After each use: - Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with warm running water. - Let them air dry on clean paper towels. - Later, hook up the nebulizer and run air through the machine for 20 seconds to make sure all of the parts are dry. - Take apart and store the machine in a covered area until the next use. Once per day, you may add a mild dish soap to the cleaning routine above. Once or twice each week: - You may add a soaking step to the cleaning routine above. - Soak the cup and mouthpiece in 1 part distilled white vinegar, 2 parts warm water solution. You may clean the outside of your machine with a warm, damp cloth as necessary. Never wash the hose or tubing. You will also need to change the filter. The instructions that come with your nebulizer will tell you when you should change the filter. Most nebulizers are small, so they are easy to transport. You may carry your nebulizer in your carry-on luggage when traveling by plane. - Keep your nebulizer covered and packed in a safe place. - Pack your medicines in a cool, dry place when traveling. Call your doctor if you are having trouble using your nebulizer. You should also call if you have any of these problems while using your nebulizer: - Anxiety - Feeling that your heart is racing or pounding (palpitations) - Shortness of breath - Feeling very excited These may be signs that you are getting too much medicine.

-0.818181818182	what is copd	COPD - managing stress and your mood (How Your Emotions can Affect COPD): Having COPD can change how you feel about yourself. And how you feel about yourself can affect COPD symptoms and how well you care for yourself. People with COPD who are depressed may have more COPD flare-ups and may have to go to the hospital more often. Depression saps your energy and motivation. When you are depressed, you may be less likely to: - Eat well and exercise. - Take your medicines as directed. - Follow your treatment plan. - Get enough rest. Or, you may get too much rest. Stress is a known COPD trigger. When you feel stressed and anxious, you may breathe faster, which can make you feel short of breath. When it is harder to breathe, you feel more anxious, and the cycle continues, leading you to feel even worse.
2.0	what is epilepsy	Epilepsy: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity—from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development—can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.
1.9	what is epilepsy	What is Epilepsy?: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well, surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special diets can help some children with epilepsy.

1.7	what is epilepsy	Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn&apost mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age. Epilepsy care at Mayo Clinic Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they&aposre called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don&apost cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn&apost return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You&aposre experiencing heat exhaustion. - You&aposre pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You&aposve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: - Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it&aposs likely that there&aposs a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures. - Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. - Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. - Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. - Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. - Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: - Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. - Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. - Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. - Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. - Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. - Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. - Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won&apost develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it&aposs common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you&aposre not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you&aposre awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you&aposre having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you&aposve had an MRI and EEG that didn&apost pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&aposs injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment. Doctors generally begin by treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don&apost treat the condition, doctors may propose surgery or another type of treatment. Medication Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, which is also called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Many children with epilepsy who aren&apost experiencing epilepsy symptoms can eventually discontinue medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won&apost interact with them. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single medication at a relatively low dosage and may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Anti-seizure medications may have some side effects. Mild side effects include: - Fatigue - Dizziness - Weight gain - Loss of bone density - Skin rashes - Loss of coordination - Speech problems - Memory and thinking problems More-severe but rare side effects include: - Depression - Suicidal thoughts and behaviors - Severe rash - Inflammation of certain organs, such as your liver To achieve the best seizure control possible with medication, follow these steps: - Take medications exactly as prescribed. - Always call your doctor before switching to a generic version of your medication or taking other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. - Never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. - Notify your doctor immediately if you notice new or increased feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in your mood or behaviors. - Tell your doctor if you have migraines. Doctors may prescribe one of the anti-epileptic medications that can prevent your migraines and treat epilepsy. At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy will become seizure-free with their first medication. If anti-epileptic medications don&apost provide satisfactory results, your doctor may suggest surgery or other therapies. You&aposll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to evaluate your condition and medications. Surgery When medications fail to provide adequate control over seizures, surgery may be an option. With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that&aposs causing seizures. Doctors usually perform surgery when tests show that: - Your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain - The area in your brain to be operated on doesn&apost interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing Although many people continue to need some medication to help prevent seizures after successful surgery, you may be able to take fewer drugs and reduce your dosages. In a small number of cases, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications such as permanently altering your thinking (cognitive) abilities. Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure you&aposre considering. Therapies Apart from medications and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy: - Vagus nerve stimulation. In vagus nerve stimulation, doctors implant a device called a vagus nerve stimulator underneath the skin of your chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in your neck. The battery-powered device sends bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to your brain. It&aposs not clear how this inhibits seizures, but the device can usually reduce seizures by 20 to 40 percent. Most people still need to take anti-epileptic medication, although some people may be able to lower their medication dose. You may experience side effects from vagus nerve stimulation, such as throat pain, hoarse voice, shortness of breath or coughing. - Ketogenic diet. Some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a strict diet that&aposs high in fats and low in carbohydrates. In this diet, called a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. After a few years, some children may be able to stop the ketogenic diet - under close supervision of their doctors - and remain seizure-free. Consult a doctor if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet. It&aposs important to make sure that your child doesn&apost become malnourished when following the diet. Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include dehydration, constipation, slowed growth because of nutritional deficiencies and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can cause kidney stones. These side effects are uncommon if the diet is properly and medically supervised. Following a ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Low-glycemic index and modified Atkins diets offer less restrictive alternatives that may still provide some benefit for seizure control. Potential future treatments Researchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including: - Deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain, typically your thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest or the skull that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your seizures. - Responsive neurostimulation. Implantable, pacemaker-like devices that help prevent seizures are also under investigation. These responsive stimulation or closed loop devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures before they happen and deliver an electrical charge or drug to stop the seizure. - Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone (subthreshold stimulation). Subthreshold stimulation - continuous stimulation to an area of your brain below a level that&aposs physically noticeable - appears to improve seizure outcomes and quality of life for some people with seizures. This treatment approach may work in people who have seizures that start in an area of the brain that can&apost be removed because it would affect speech and motor functions (eloquent area). Or it might benefit people whose seizure characteristics mean their chances of successful treatment with responsive neurostimulation are low. - Minimally invasive surgery. New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI-guided laser ablation, show promise at reducing seizures with fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy. - Stereotactic laser ablation or radiosurgery. For some types of epilepsy, stereotactic laser ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery may provide effective treatment for people in which an open procedure may be too risky. In these procedures, doctors direct radiation at the specific area in the brain causing seizures, to destroy that tissue in an effort to better control the seizures. - External nerve stimulation device. Similar to vagus nerve stimulation, this device would stimulate specific nerves to reduce frequency of seizures. But unlike vagus nerve stimulation, this device would be worn externally so that no surgery to implant the device is needed. Understanding your condition can help you take better control of it: - Take your medication correctly. Don&apost adjust your dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly. - Exercise. Exercising may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water, and rest if you get tired during exercise. In addition, make healthy life choices, such as managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes.
1.8	what is epilepsy	Epilepsy - overview: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal firing of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior. Epilepsy occurs when permanent changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain sends out abnormal signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.) Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). Common causes of epilepsy include: - Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) - Dementia, such as Alzheimer disease - Traumatic brain injury - Infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS - Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect) - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth - Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria) - Brain tumor - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain - Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue Epileptic seizures usually begin between ages 5 and 20. There is also a higher chance of seizures in adults older than 60. But epileptic seizures can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy. Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have simple staring spells. Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness. The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected. Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura. Your doctor can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have: - Absence (petit mal) seizure (staring spells) - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure (involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness) - Partial (focal) seizure (can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts) The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life. - Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called video EEG. Tests that may be done include: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for epilepsy includes taking medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery. If epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery to treat these disorders may make the seizures stop. Medicines to prevent seizures, called anticonvulsants (or antiepileptic drugs), may reduce the number of future seizures: - These drugs are taken by mouth. Which type you are prescribed depends on the type of seizures you have. - Your dosage may need to be changed from time to time. You may need regular blood tests to check for side effects. - Always take your medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause you to have a seizure. DO NOT stop taking or change medicines on your own. Talk to your doctor first. - Many epilepsy medicines cause birth defects. Women who plan to become pregnant should tell their doctor in advance in order to adjust medicines. Many epilepsy drugs may affect the health of your bones. Talk to your doctor about whether you need vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that does not get better after 2 or 3 anti-seizure drugs have been tried is called "medically refractory epilepsy." In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to: - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, may also be helpful in some adults. Be sure to discuss these options with your doctor before trying them. Lifestyle or medical changes can increase the risk for a seizure in adults and children with epilepsy. Talk with your doctor about: - New prescribed drugs, vitamins, or supplements - Emotional stress - Illness, especially infection - Lack of sleep - Pregnancy - Skipping doses of epilepsy medicines - Use of alcohol or other recreational drugs Other considerations: - People with epilepsy should wear medical alert jewelry so that prompt treatment can be obtained if a seizure occurs. - People with poorly controlled epilepsy should not drive. Check your state&aposs law about which people with a history of seizures are allowed to drive. - DO NOT use machinery or do activities that can cause loss of awareness, such as climbing to high places, biking, and swimming alone. The stress of having epilepsy or being a caretaker of someone with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Some people with epilepsy may be able to reduce or even stop their anti-seizure medicines after having no seizures for several years. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. For many people, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, anti-seizure drugs need to be continued. There is a very low risk for sudden death with epilepsy. Complications may include: - Difficulty learning - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia - Injury from falls, bumps, self-inflicted bites, driving or operating machinery during a seizure - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage) - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - This is the first time a person has a seizure - A seizure occurs in someone who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do) In the case of someone who has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations: - This is a longer seizure than the person normally has, or an unusual number of seizures for the person - Repeated seizures over a few minutes - Repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus) Call your doctor if any new symptoms occur: - Loss of hair - Nausea or vomiting - Rash - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, sedation - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep, and staying away from alcohol and illegal drugs may decrease the likelihood of triggering seizures in people with epilepsy. Reduce the risk for head injury by wearing a helmet during risky activities. This can lessen the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Amit M.

0.6	what is epilepsy	Epilepsy - children: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. A seizure is a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A single seizure that does not happen again is NOT epilepsy. Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown. Common causes of epilepsy include: - Traumatic brain injury - Damage or scarring after infections of the brain - Birth defects that involve the brain - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth - Metabolic disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria) - Benign brain tumor, often very small - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain - Stroke - Other illnesses that damage or destroy brain tissue Epileptic seizures usually start between ages 5 and 20. But they can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy. A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever. Most of the time, a febrile seizure is not a sign that the child has epilepsy. Symptoms vary from child to child. Some children may simply stare. Others may shake violently and lose alertness. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected. Your child&aposs health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure your child may have: - Absence (petit mal) seizure: Staring spells - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure: Involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness - Partial (focal) seizure: Can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some children have a strange sensation before a seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, feeling fear or anxiety for no reason or having a sense of déjà vu (feeling that something has happened before). This is called an aura. The provider will: - Ask about your child&aposs medical and family history in detail - Ask about the seizure episode - Do a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system The provider will order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities - Stay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG) The provider also may order other tests, including: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often, PET scan of the brain is needed to help plan surgery. Treatment for epilepsy includes: - Medicines - Lifestyle changes - Surgery If your child&aposs epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed. Medicines to prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs. These may reduce the number of future seizures. - These medicines are taken by mouth. The type of medicine prescribed depends on the type of seizure your child has. - The dosage may need to be changed from time to time. The provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects. - Always make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do NOT stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to the provider first. Many epilepsy drugs may affect your child&aposs bone health. Talk to your child&aposs provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure drugs is called "medically refractory epilepsy." In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to: - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child&aposs provider before trying them. Epilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include: - Taking medicines - Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on  - Managing stress and sleep - Avoiding alcohol and drug abuse - Keeping up in school - Managing other illnesses Managing these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge. The stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Most children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, the provider may stop medicines. For many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued. Children who have developmental disorders that also cause epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life. Knowing more about the condition will help you take better care of your child&aposs epilepsy. Complications may include: - Difficulty learning - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia - Irregular heartbeat - Injury from falls, bumps, or self-caused bites during a seizure - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage) - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - This is the first time your child has a seizure - A seizure occurs in a child who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do) If your child has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations: - The seizure is longer than the child normally has or the child has an unusual number of seizures - The child has repeated seizures over a few minutes - The child has repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus) - The child gets injured during the seizure - The child has difficulty breathing Call the provider if your child has new symptoms: - Nausea or vomiting - Rash - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination Contact the provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped. There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy. Reduce the risk of head injury during risky activities. This can decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Neil K.

0.5	what is epilepsy	Progressive myoclonic epilepsy: Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) refers to a group of inherited conditions involving the central nervous system and representing more than a dozen different diseases. These diseases share certain features, including a worsening of symptoms over time and the presence of both muscle contractions ( myoclonus) and seizures ( epilepsy). PME is different from myoclonic epilepsy. [1] Other features include  dementia , dystonia , and trouble walking or speaking. These rare disorders often get worse over time and sometimes are fatal. Many of these PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence. [2] The following diseases are related to Progressive myoclonic epilepsy. If you have a question about any of these diseases, you can contact GARD.

0.4	what is epilepsy	Epilepsy juvenile absence: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a &apos&aposstaring spell&apos&apos that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

0.3	what is epilepsy	Epilepsy occipital calcifications: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1459 Disease definition Celiac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome (CEC) is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of auto-immune intestinal disease, epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications. Epidemiology CEC was first described in 1992 and fewer than 200 cases have been reported so far. Clinical description Celiac disease (CD, see this term) and epilepsy manifest at a variable age, and CD is frequently diagnosed in late childhood, when specific investigations are performed secondary to observation of epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications (CC). CD can present in a typical form characterized by onset in the first 2 years of life, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, short stature , anorexia, and, in some cases, irritability and vomiting. CD may also present in silent or latent forms, which are characterized - in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms - by dermatitis herpetiformis, dental enamel defects or autoimmune thyroiditis. In CEC patients, CD usually evolves into latent, silent or paucisymptomatic forms. Epilepsy onset is between infancy and adulthood; most cases occur in early childhood. Most patients present with occipital epileptic seizures, the course being highly variable, with benign, drug-resistant, or epileptic encephalopathy forms. In the latter, severe mental deterioration and/or learning disorders have been reported while a mild mental deterioration is observed in only one third of all CEC cases. CCs are seen in subcortical parieto-occipital regions. CC size does not change significantly over time, but in several cases, new CCs appeared in other regions. Patients with CCs and CD without epilepsy are considered as having an incomplete form of CEC. Some patients with epilepsy and CC without CD are considered to have a CEC with latent CD. Etiology Etiology of CEC is unclear. It is not known if epilepsy and/or CC are a consequence of CD. CD is an immune auto-inflammatory reaction occurring in predisposed gluten-intolerant individuals. It originates from the jejunal mucosa and spreads to the lamina propria, leading to the observed histopathological features (crypt hyperplasia, jejunal villous atrophy and inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria). CD may induce autoimmune responses outside the gastrointestinal tract. Circulating activated T cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and be toxic to myelin or myelin-producing cells. As for isolated CD, CEC is associated with the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes . Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on anamnestic investigation and EEG to characterize epileptic seizures. Computed tomography (CT) imaging reveals CC. Laboratory findings (antiendomisium antibodies , antigliadin antibodies, anti- tissue -transglutaminase type 2 antibodies, HLA phenotype ), and histopathological analysis of small bowel biopsy (jejunal mucosa villous atrophy) enable identification of silent or latent CD in a patient with epileptic seizures and CC. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis of CEC includes Sturge-Weber syndrome (see this term) without nevus flammeus and other conditions such as congenital folate malabsorption or adverse effects of methotrexate, antifolate agents and radiotherapy of leukemic children. Management and treatment CD requires life-long observance of a gluten-free diet (GFD), leading to clinical and histopathological resolution of symptoms. A study has revealed that early CD diagnosis and treatment by GFD could prevent or reverse the epileptic disorder. Prognosis Early diagnosis and good compliance of GFD greatly improve outcome. On the contrary, if treatment is delayed, epilepsy may be more severe and epileptic encephalopathy may develop. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.

2.0	what is the cause of congenital heart defects	Congenital Heart Defects (CAUSES): If your child has a congenital heart defect, you may think you did something wrong during your pregnancy to cause the problem. However, doctors often don&apost know why congenital heart defects occur. Heredity may play a role in some heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the defect. Rarely, more than one child in a family is born with a heart defect. Children who have genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, often have congenital heart defects. In fact, half of all babies who have Down syndrome have congenital heart defects. Smoking during pregnancy also has been linked to several congenital heart defects, including septal defects. Researchers continue to search for the causes of congenital heart defects.
-0.5	what is the cause of congenital heart defects	How to diagnose Congenital Heart Defects?: Severe congenital heart defects generally are diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after birth. Less severe defects often aren&apost diagnosed until children are older. Minor defects often have no signs or symptoms. Doctors may diagnose them based on results from a physical exam and tests done for another reason. Specialists Involved Pediatric cardiologists are doctors who specialize in the care of babies and children who have heart problems. Cardiac surgeons are specialists who repair heart defects using surgery. Physical Exam During a physical exam, the doctor will: Listen to your child&aposs heart and lungs with a stethoscope Look for signs of a heart defect, such as cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, or fingernails), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, delayed growth, or signs of heart failure Diagnostic Tests Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. During the test, the sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen. Echo allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it&aposs working. Echo is an important test for both diagnosing a heart problem and following the problem over time. The test can show problems with the heart&aposs structure and how the heart is reacting to those problems. Echo will help your child&aposs cardiologist decide if and when treatment is needed. During pregnancy, if your doctor suspects that your baby has a congenital heart defect, fetal echo can be done. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the baby&aposs heart while the baby is still in the womb. Fetal echo usually is done at about 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy. If your child is diagnosed with a congenital heart defect before birth, your doctor can plan treatment before the baby is born. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart&aposs electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. An EKG can detect if one of the heart&aposs chambers is enlarged, which can help diagnose a heart problem. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether the heart is enlarged. It also can show whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure. Pulse Oximetry For this test, a small sensor is attached to a finger or toe (like an adhesive bandage). The sensor gives an estimate of how much oxygen is in the blood. Cardiac Catheterization During cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded to the heart. Special dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the hearts chambers. The dye allows the doctor to see blood flowing through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image. The doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure and oxygen level inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. This can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart. Cardiac catheterization also is used to repair some heart defects.
-0.75	what is the cause of congenital heart defects	Congenital Heart Defects (LIVING WITH): The outlook for children who have congenital heart defects is much better today than in the past. Advances in testing and treatment allow most of these children to survive to adulthood. They’re able to live active, productive lives. Many of these children need only occasional checkups with a cardiologist (heart specialist) as they grow up and go through adult life. Children who have complex heart defects need long-term care from trained specialists. This will help them stay as healthy as possible and maintain a good quality of life. Children and Teens Ongoing Medical Care Ongoing medical care is important for your child&aposs health. This includes: Having checkups with your child&aposs heart specialist as directed Seeing your child’s pediatrician or family doctor for routine exams Taking medicines as prescribed Children who have severe heart defects may be at slightly increased risk for infective endocarditis (IE). IE is a serious infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Your child&aposs doctor or dentist may give your child antibiotics before some medical or dental procedures (such as surgery or dental cleanings) that can allow bacteria into the bloodstream. Your child&aposs doctor will tell you whether your child needs antibiotics before such procedures. To reduce the risk of IE, gently brush your young child&aposs teeth every day as soon as they begin to come in. As your child gets older, make sure he or she brushes every day and sees a dentist regularly. Talk with your child&aposs doctor and dentist about how to keep your child&aposs mouth and teeth healthy. As children who have heart defects grow up and become teens, they should learn how their hearts differ from normal hearts. They also should know what kind of defect they have, how it was treated, and what kind of care is still needed. They should be able to recognize signs and symptoms and know how to respond. Work with your child’s health care providers to compile a packet of medical records and information that covers all aspects of your child&aposs heart defect, including: Diagnosis Procedures or surgeries Prescribed medicines Recommendations about medical followup and how to prevent complications Health insurance Review your current health insurance plan so you understand your coverage. Keeping your health insurance current is important. If you plan to change jobs, find out whether your new health insurance will cover care for your child&aposs congenital heart defect. Feeding and Nutrition Some babies and children who have congenital heart defects don&apost grow and develop as fast as other children. If your child&aposs heart has to pump harder than normal because of a heart defect, he or she may tire quickly while feeding. As a result, your child may not be able to eat enough. Poor feeding may cause your child to be smaller and thinner than other children. Your child also may start certain activities—such as rolling over, sitting, and walking—later than other children. After treatments and surgery, growth and development often improve. To help your baby get enough calories, ask his or her doctor about the best feeding schedule. Also, ask whether your baby needs any nutritional supplements. Make sure your child has nutritious meals and snacks as he or she grows. This will help with growth and development. Physical Activity Physical activity helps children strengthen their muscles and stay healthy. Ask your child&aposs doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are best for your child. Some children and teens who have congenital heart defects may need to limit the amount or type of activity they do. Remember to ask the doctor for a note that describes any limits on your child&aposs physical activities. Schools and other groups may need this information. Emotional Issues Children and teens who have serious conditions or illnesses may have emotional issues. For example, they may feel isolated if they have to be in the hospital a lot. Some may feel sad or frustrated with their body image and their inability to be a "normal" kid. Sometimes brothers or sisters are jealous of a child who needs a lot of attention for medical problems. If you have concerns about your child&aposs emotional health, talk with his or her doctor. Transition of Care The move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. Talk with your teen’s health care team about creating a plan to help your teen transition to adult care. Start planning as soon as your teen is able and willing to fully take part in this process. Following a transition plan has many benefits. It will help your teen: Get used to talking with health care providers Learn about the adult health care system Understand the importance of having health insurance and learn what his or her insurance covers Take responsibility for his or her medical care A transition plan also can help your teen think about other important issues, such as future education and employment, birth control and pregnancy planning, and making healthy choices about nutrition, physical activity, and other lifestyle habits. Adults Adults who needed regular medical checkups for congenital heart defects in their youth may need to keep seeing specialists into adulthood. These adults should pay attention to the following issues. Medical History Some people think that the surgery they had in childhood for their congenital heart defects was a cure. They don&apost realize they may need regular medical followup in adulthood to maintain good health. Some adults may not know what kind of heart defect they had (or still have) or how it was repaired. They should learn about their medical history and know as much as possible about any medicines they&aposre taking. Preventing Infective Endocarditis People who have congenital heart defects may need antibiotics before some medical or dental procedures that can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream. These bacteria can cause infective endocarditis (IE). IE is a serious infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Your doctor will tell you whether you need to take antibiotics before medical or dental procedures. Regular brushing, flossing, and visits to the dentist also can help prevent IE. Birth Control and Pregnancy Women who have heart defects should talk with their doctors about the safest type of birth control for them. Many of these women can safely use most methods. However, some women should avoid certain types of birth control, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs). Many women who have simple heart defects can have normal pregnancies and deliveries. Women with congenital heart defects who want to become pregnant (or who are pregnant) should talk with their doctors about the health risks. They also should consult with doctors who specialize in treating pregnant women who have congenital heart defects. Women who have congenital heart defects may be at higher risk than other women of having babies who have congenital heart defects. Pregnant women who have congenital heart defects should talk with their doctors about whether to have fetal echocardiography (echo). This test uses sound waves to create images of the baby&aposs heart. Fetal echo gives the doctor information about the size and shape of the baby&aposs heart. This test also shows how well the heart’s chambers and valves are working. Health Insurance and Employment Adults who have congenital heart defects should carefully consider how changing jobs will affect their health insurance coverage. Some health plans have waiting periods or clauses to exclude some kinds of coverage. Before making any job changes, find out whether the change will affect your insurance coverage. Several laws protect the employment rights of people who have health conditions, such as congenital heart defects. The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Work Incentives Improvement Act try to ensure fairness in hiring for all people, including those who have health conditions.
1.75	what is the cause of congenital heart defects	Congenital heart defects in children (Risk factors): Most congenital heart defects result from problems early in your child&aposs heart development, the cause of which is unknown. However, certain environmental and genetic risk factors may play a role. They include: - Rubella (German measles). Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in your baby&aposs heart development. Your doctor can test you for immunity to this viral disease before pregnancy and vaccinate you against it if you aren&apost immune. - Diabetes. You can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects by carefully controlling your diabetes before attempting to conceive and during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes generally doesn&apost increase your baby&aposs risk of developing a heart defect. - Medications. Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects. Give your doctor a complete list of medications you take before attempting to become pregnant. Medications known to increase the risk of congenital heart defects include thalidomide (Thalomid), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, the acne medication isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and lithium. - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Avoid alcohol during pregnancy because it increases the risk of congenital heart defects. - Smoking. Smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of a congenital heart defect in the baby. - Heredity. Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families and may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome - which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome (trisomy 21) - have heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects. Genetic testing can detect such disorders during fetal development. If you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, a genetic counselor can estimate the odds that your next child will have one.
-0.333333333333	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Overview): Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unreasonable thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior - the vicious cycle of OCD. OCD often centers around certain themes - for example, a fear of getting contaminated by germs. To ease your contamination fears, you may compulsively wash your hands until they&aposre sore and chapped. If you have OCD, you may be ashamed and embarrassed about the condition, but treatment can be effective.
2.0	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Causes): The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder isn&apost fully understood. Main theories include: - Biology. OCD may be a result of changes in your body&aposs own natural chemistry or brain functions. - Genetics. OCD may have a genetic component, but specific genes have yet to be identified. - Environment. Some environmental factors such as infections are suggested as a trigger for OCD, but more research is needed.
1.88888888889	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Risk factors): Factors that may increase the risk of developing or triggering obsessive-compulsive disorder include: - Family history. Having parents or other family members with the disorder can increase your risk of developing OCD. - Stressful life events. If you&aposve experienced traumatic or stressful events, your risk may increase. This reaction may, for some reason, trigger the intrusive thoughts, rituals and emotional distress characteristic of OCD. - Other mental health disorders. OCD may be related to other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse or tic disorders.
-0.666666666667	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Lifestyle and home remedies): Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition, which means it may always be part of your life. While OCD warrants treatment by a professional, you can do some things for yourself to build on your treatment plan: - Take your medications as directed. Even if you&aposre feeling well, resist any temptation to skip your medications. If you stop, OCD symptoms are likely to return. - Pay attention to warning signs. You and your doctor may have identified issues that can trigger your OCD symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. - Check first before taking other medications. Contact the doctor who&aposs treating you for OCD before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, herbal remedies or other supplements to avoid possible interactions. - Practice what you learn. Work with your mental health professional to identify techniques and skills that help manage symptoms, and practice these regularly.
0.777777777778	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (Summary): Summary Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. If you have OCD, you have frequent, upsetting thoughts called obsessions. To try to control the thoughts, you feel an overwhelming urge to repeat certain rituals or behaviors. These are called compulsions. Examples of obsessions are a fear of germs or a fear of being hurt. Compulsions include washing your hands, counting, checking on things, or cleaning. With OCD, the thoughts and rituals cause distress and get in the way of your daily life. Researchers think brain circuits may not work properly in people who have OCD. It tends to run in families. The symptoms often begin in children or teens. Treatments include therapy, medicines, or both. One type of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, is useful for treating OCD.

-0.777777777778	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Diagnosis): Steps to help diagnose OCD may include: - Physical exam. This may be done to help rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms and to check for any related complications. - Lab tests. These may include, for example, a complete blood count (CBC), a check of your thyroid function, and screening for alcohol and drugs. - Psychological evaluation. This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings, symptoms and behavior patterns. With your permission, this may include talking to your family or friends. - Diagnostic criteria for OCD. Your doctor may use criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic challenges It&aposs sometimes difficult to diagnose OCD because symptoms can be similar to those of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia or other mental health disorders. And it&aposs possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder. Work with your doctor so that you can get the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
-0.444444444444	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Symptoms): Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it&aposs also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social or work functioning. OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you&aposre trying to think of or do other things. Obsessions often have themes to them, such as: - Fear of contamination or dirt - Needing things orderly and symmetrical - Aggressive or horrific thoughts about harming yourself or others - Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include: - Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched - Doubts that you&aposve locked the door or turned off the stove - Intense stress when objects aren&apost orderly or facing a certain way - Images of hurting yourself or someone else that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable - Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately that are unwanted and make you uncomfortable - Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands - Distress about unpleasant sexual images repeating in your mind OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to prevent or reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you&aposre having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they&aposre intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as: - Washing and cleaning - Checking - Counting - Orderliness - Following a strict routine - Demanding reassurances Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include: - Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw - Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they&aposre locked - Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it&aposs off - Counting in certain patterns - Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase - Arranging your canned goods to face the same way OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. There&aposs a difference between being a perfectionist - someone who requires flawless results or performance, for example - and having OCD. OCD thoughts aren&apost simply excessive worries about real problems in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way. If your obsessions and compulsions are affecting your quality of life, see your doctor or mental health professional.
-0.555555555556	what is the cause of ocd	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Treatment): Obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment may not result in a cure, but it can help bring symptoms under control so that they don&apost rule your daily life. Some people need treatment for the rest of their lives. The two main treatments for OCD are psychotherapy and medications. Often, treatment is most effective with a combination of these. Psychotherapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy, is effective for many people with OCD. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a type of CBT therapy, involves gradually exposing you to a feared object or obsession, such as dirt, and having you learn healthy ways to cope with your anxiety. ERP takes effort and practice, but you may enjoy a better quality of life once you learn to manage your obsessions and compulsions. Therapy may take place in individual, family or group sessions. Medications Certain psychiatric medications can help control the obsessions and compulsions of OCD. Most commonly, antidepressants are tried first. Antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat OCD include: - Clomipramine (Anafranil) for adults and children 10 years and older - Fluoxetine (Prozac) for adults and children 7 years and older - Fluvoxamine for adults and children 8 years and older - Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) for adults only - Sertraline (Zoloft) for adults and children 6 years and older However, your doctor may prescribe other antidepressants and psychiatric medications. Medications: What to consider Here are some issues to discuss with your doctor about medications for OCD: - Choosing a medication. In general, the goal is to effectively control symptoms at the lowest possible dosage. It&aposs not unusual to try several drugs before finding one that works well. Your doctor might recommend more than one medication to effectively manage your symptoms. It can take weeks to months after starting a medication to notice an improvement in symptoms. - Side effects. All psychiatric medications have potential side effects. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects and about any health monitoring needed while taking psychiatric drugs. And let your doctor know if you experience troubling side effects. - Suicide risk. Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the FDA requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. If suicidal thoughts occur, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help. Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood. - Interactions with other substances. When taking an antidepressant, tell your doctor about any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbs or other supplements you take. Some antidepressants can cause dangerous reactions when combined with certain medications or herbal supplements. - Stopping antidepressants. Antidepressants aren&apost considered addictive, but sometimes physical dependence (which is different from addiction) can occur. So stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms, sometimes called discontinuation syndrome. Don&apost stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor, even if you&aposre feeling better - you may have a relapse of OCD symptoms. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific medications. Other treatment Sometimes, medications and psychotherapy aren&apost effective enough to control OCD symptoms. Research continues on the potential effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating OCD that doesn&apost respond to traditional treatment approaches. Because DBS hasn&apost been thoroughly tested for use in treating OCD, make sure you understand all the pros and cons and possible health risks.

-0.857142857143	what is the cause of the coffin lowry syndrome?	Coffin Lowry Syndrome (Prognosis): The prognosis for individuals with Coffin-Lowry syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms. Early intervention may improve the outlook for patients. Life span is reduced in some individuals with Coffin-Lowry syndrome.
2.0	what is the cause of the coffin lowry syndrome?	What is Coffin Lowry Syndrome?: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial (head and facial) and skeletal abnormalities, delayed intellectual development, short stature, and hypotonia. Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone (maxillary hypoplasia), a broad nose, protruding nostrils (nares), an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. It is unclear how changes (mutations) in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings.
-0.571428571429	what is the cause of the coffin lowry syndrome?	Coffin Lowry Syndrome (Treatment): There is no cure and no standard course of treatment for Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include physical and speech therapy and educational services.
1.71428571429	what is the cause of the coffin lowry syndrome?	Coffin-Lowry syndrome: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. The signs and symptoms are usually more severe in males than in females, although the features of this disorder range from very mild to severe in affected women. Males with Coffin-Lowry syndrome typically have severe to profound intellectual disability and delayed development. Affected women may be cognitively normal, or they may have intellectual disability ranging from mild to profound. Beginning in childhood or adolescence, some people with this condition experience brief episodes of collapse when excited or startled by a loud noise. These attacks are called stimulus-induced drop episodes (SIDEs). Most affected males and some affected females have distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, widely spaced and downward-slanting eyes, a short nose with a wide tip, and a wide mouth with full lips. These features become more pronounced with age. Soft hands with short, tapered fingers are also characteristic of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Additional features of this condition include short stature, an unusually small head (microcephaly), progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), and other skeletal abnormalities. The incidence of this condition is uncertain, but researchers estimate that the disorder affects 1 in 40,000 to 50,000 people. Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in signaling within cells. Researchers believe that this protein helps control the activity of other genes and plays an important role in the brain. The protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that are required for learning, the formation of long-term memories, and the survival of nerve cells. Gene mutations result in the production of little or no RPS6KA3 protein, but it is unclear how a lack of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Some people with the features of Coffin-Lowry syndrome do not have identified mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, males (who have one X chromosome in each cell) experience more severe signs and symptoms of the disorder than females (who have two X chromosomes in each cell). A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. Between 70 percent and 80 percent of people with Coffin-Lowry syndrome have no history of the condition in their families. These cases are caused by new mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene. The remaining 20 percent to 30 percent of affected individuals have other family members with Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Hanauer A, Young ID. Coffin-Lowry syndrome: clinical and molecular features.

1.85714285714	what is the disorder achondroplasia	Achondroplasia: Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that causes the most common type of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is one of a group of disorders called chondrodystrophies, or osteochondrodysplasias. Achondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, which means that if a child gets the defective gene from 1 parent, the child will have the disorder. If 1 parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant&aposs chances of being affected increase to 75%. However, most cases appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that 2 parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition. The typical appearance of achondroplastic dwarfism can be seen at birth. Symptoms may include: - Abnormal hand appearance with persistent space between the long and ring fingers - Bowed legs - Decreased muscle tone - Disproportionately large head-to-body size difference - Prominent forehead (frontal bossing) - Shortened arms and legs (especially the upper arm and thigh) - Short stature (significantly below the average height for a person of the same age and sex) - Narrowing of the spinal column spinal stenosis - Spine curvatures called kyphosis and lordosis During pregnancy, a prenatal ultrasound may show excessive amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn infant. Examination of the infant after birth shows increased front-to-back head size. There may be signs of hydrocephalus ("water on the brain"). X-rays of the long bones can reveal achondroplasia in the newborn. There is no specific treatment for achondroplasia. Related abnormalities, including spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression, should be treated when they cause problems. People with achondroplasia seldom reach 5 feet (1.5 meters) in height. Intelligence is in the normal range. Infants who receive the abnormal gene from both parents do not often live beyond a few months. Health problems that may develop include: - Breathing problems from a small upper airway and from pressure on the area of the brain that controls breathing - Lung problems from a small ribcage If there is a family history of achondroplasia and you plan to have children, you may find it helpful to speak to your health care provider. Genetic counseling may be helpful for prospective parents when 1 or both have achondroplasia. However, because achondroplasia most often develops spontaneously, prevention is not always possible.

2.0	what is the disorder achondroplasia	What is Achondroplasia?: Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that prevents the changing of cartilage (particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs) to bone. It is characterized by dwarfism, limited range of motion at the elbows, large head size, small fingers, and normal intelligence. Achondroplasia can cause health complications such as apnea, obesity, recurrent ear infections, and lordosis of the spine. Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

2.0	what is the treatment for lymphoma	Lymphoma (Treatment): Which lymphoma treatments are right for you depends on the type and stage of your disease, your overall health, and your preferences. The goal of treatment is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible and bring the disease into remission. Lymphoma treatments include: - Active surveillance. Some forms of lymphoma are very slow growing. You and your doctor may decide to wait to treat your lymphoma when it causes signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily activities. Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered through a vein, but can also be taken as a pill, depending on the specific drugs you receive. - Other drug therapy. Other drugs used to treat lymphoma include targeted drugs that focus on specific abnormalities in your cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, involves using high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress your bone marrow. Then healthy bone marrow stem cells from your body or from a donor are infused into your blood where they travel to your bones and rebuild your bone marrow.

Radiation therapy of the whole brain may be done after chemotherapy. Boosting the immune system, such as in those with HIV, may also be tried.
0.666666666667	what is the treatment for lymphoma	Hodgkin lymphoma (Treatment): Treatment depends on the following: - The type of Hodgkin lymphoma (there are different forms of Hodgkin lymphoma) - The stage (where the disease has spread) - Whether the tumor is more than 4 inches (10 cm) wide - Your age and other medical issues - Other factors, including weight loss, night sweats, and fever You may receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. Your doctor can tell you more about your specific treatment. High-dose chemotherapy may be given when Hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment or does not respond to the first treatment. This is followed by a stem cell transplant that uses your own stem cells. You and your health care provider may need to manage other concerns during your leukemia treatment, including: - Having chemotherapy at home - Managing your pets during chemotherapy - Bleeding problems - Dry mouth - Eating enough calories - Safe eating during cancer treatment
0.888888888889	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Brucellosis (Overview): Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that spreads from animals to people - most often via unpasteurized milk, cheese and other dairy products. More rarely, the bacteria that cause brucellosis can spread through the air or through direct contact with infected animals. Brucellosis symptoms may include fever, joint pain and fatigue. The infection can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics. Treatment takes several weeks to months, however, and relapses are common. While brucellosis is uncommon in the United States, the disease affects hundreds of thousands of people and animals worldwide. Avoiding unpasteurized dairy products and taking precautions when working with animals or in a laboratory can help prevent brucellosis.
-0.222222222222	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	What is Brucellosis?: Brucellosis is an infectious disease that occurs from contact with animals carrying brucella bacteria.
-0.888888888889	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Brucellosis (Complications): Brucellosis can affect almost any part of your body, including your reproductive system, liver, heart and central nervous system. Chronic brucellosis may cause complications in just one organ or throughout your body. Possible complications include: - Infection of the heart&aposs inner lining (endocarditis). This is one of the most serious complications of brucellosis. Untreated endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves and is the leading cause of brucellosis-related deaths. - Arthritis. Joint infection is marked by pain, stiffness and swelling in your joints, especially the knees, hips, ankles, wrists and spine. Spondylitis - inflammation of the joints between the bones (vertebrae) of your spine or between your spine and pelvis - can be particularly hard to treat and may cause lasting damage. - Inflammation and infection of the testicles (epididymo-orchitis). The bacteria that cause brucellosis can infect the epididymis, the coiled tube that connects the vas deferens and the testicle. From there, the infection may spread to the testicle itself, causing swelling and pain, which may be severe. - Inflammation and infection of the spleen and liver. Brucellosis can also affect the spleen and liver, causing them to enlarge beyond their normal size. - Central nervous system infections. These include potentially life-threatening illnesses such as meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and encephalitis, inflammation of the brain itself.
-0.333333333333	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Brucellosis (Risk factors): Brucellosis is very rare in the United States. Other parts of the world have much higher rates of brucellosis infection, especially: - Around the Mediterranean Sea - Eastern Europe - Latin America - Asia - Africa - The Caribbean - The Middle East People who live or travel in these areas are more likely to consume unpasteurized goat cheese, sometimes called village cheese. Unpasteurized goat cheese imported from Mexico has been linked to many cases of brucellosis in the United States. Occupations at higher risk People who work with animals or come into contact with infected blood are at higher risk of brucellosis. Examples include: - Veterinarians - Dairy farmers - Ranchers - Slaughterhouse workers - Hunters - Microbiologists
-0.444444444444	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Brucellosis (Causes): Brucellosis affects many wild and domestic animals. Cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, camels, wild boar and reindeer are especially prone to the disease. A form of brucellosis also affects harbor seals, porpoises and certain whales. The bacteria may be spread from animals to people in three main ways: - Raw dairy products. Brucella bacteria in the milk of infected animals can spread to humans in unpasteurized milk, ice cream, butter and cheeses. The bacteria can also be transmitted in raw or undercooked meat from infected animals. - Inhalation. Brucella bacteria spread easily in the air. Farmers, laboratory technicians and slaughterhouse workers can inhale the bacteria. - Direct contact. Bacteria in the blood, semen or placenta of an infected animal can enter your bloodstream through a cut or other wound. Because normal contact with animals - touching, brushing or playing - doesn&apost cause infection, people rarely get brucellosis from their pets. Even so, people with weakened immune systems should avoid handling dogs known to have the disease. Brucellosis normally doesn&apost spread from person to person, but in a few cases, women have passed the disease to their infants during birth or through their breast milk. Rarely, brucellosis may spread through sexual activity or through contaminated blood or bone marrow transfusions.
-0.555555555556	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Brucellosis (Diagnosis): Doctors usually confirm a diagnosis of brucellosis by testing a sample of blood or bone marrow for the brucella bacteria or by testing blood for antibodies to the bacteria. To help detect complications of brucellosis, you may have additional tests, including: - X-rays. X-rays can reveal changes in your bones and joints. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These imaging tests help identify inflammation or abscesses in the brain or other tissues. - Cerebrospinal fluid culture. This checks a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord for infections such as meningitis and encephalitis. - Echocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create images of your heart to check for signs of infection or damage to your heart.
1.0	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Brucellosis (Treatment): Treatment for brucellosis aims to relieve symptoms, prevent a relapse of the disease and avoid complications. You&aposll need to take antibiotics for at least six weeks, and your symptoms may not go away completely for several months. The disease can also return and may become chronic.
-0.666666666667	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Serology for brucellosis (Summary): Serology for brucellosis is a blood test to look for the presence of antibodies against Brucella. This is the bacteria that causes the disease brucellosis.
-0.777777777778	what medications are prescribed for brucellosis	Serology for brucellosis (Why the Test is Performed): Brucellosis is an infection that occurs from coming into contact with animals that carry Brucella bacteria. Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of brucellosis. People working in jobs where they often come in contact with animals or meat, such as slaughterhouse workers, farmers, and veterinarians, are most likely to get this disease.

Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger.
1.77777777778	what test do you do for rheumatoid "arthritis?"	Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body&aposs tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don&apost involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don&apost know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don&apost actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you&aposve had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn&apost an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you&aposre just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don&apost do any moves that cause pain.

-0.555555555556	what test do you do for rheumatoid "arthritis?"	Rheumatoid arthritis (Symptoms): Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don&apost involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints.
0.666666666667	what the treatment for bronchitis	Bronchitis (Treatment): Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks. Medications Because most cases of bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren&apost effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic. In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including: - Cough medicine. If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime. - Other medications. If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs. Therapies If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation - a breathing exercise program in which a respiratory therapist teaches you how to breathe more easily and increase your ability to exercise.
0.777777777778	what the treatment for bronchitis	What are the treatments for Bronchitis - acute?: Most people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week. Doing these things may help you feel better: - Drink plenty of fluids. - If you have asthma or another chronic lung condition, use your inhaler. - Get plenty of rest. - Take aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands) if you have a fever. Do not give aspirin to children. - Use a humidifier or steam in the bathroom. Certain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word "guaifenesin" on the label. Ask the pharmacist if you need help finding it. If your symptoms do not improve or if you are wheezing, your doctor may prescribe an inhaler to open your airways. If your doctor thinks you also have bacteria in your airways, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. This medicine will only get rid of bacteria, not viruses. A bacterial infection is more common if you also have a chronic lung disease like COPD. Sometimes, bacteria may infect the airways along with the virus. If your doctor thinks this has happened, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Sometimes, corticosteroid medicine is also needed to reduce inflammation in the lungs. Other tips include: - Do not smoke. - Avoid secondhand smoke and air pollution. - Wash your hands (and your children&aposs hands) often to avoid spreading viruses and other germs.
0.333333333333	what the treatment for bronchitis	Industrial bronchitis (Treatment): The goal of treatment is to reduce the irritation. Getting more air into the workplace or wearing masks to filter out the offending dust particles may help. Some people may need to be taken out of the workplace. Some cases of industrial bronchitis go away without treatment. Other times, a person may need inhaled anti-inflammatory medicines. If you are at risk or have experienced this problem and you smoke, stop smoking. Helpful measures include: - Breathing humidified air - Increasing fluid intake - Resting
-1.88888888889	what the treatment for bronchitis	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Treatment): There is no cure for COPD. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse. If you smoke, now is the time to quit. This is the best way to slow lung damage. Medicines used to treat COPD include: - Inhalers (bronchodilators) COPD -- quick-relief drugs to help open the airways - Inhaled COPD -- control drugs or oral steroids to reduce lung inflammation - Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the airways - Certain long-term antibiotics In severe cases or during flare-ups, you may need to receive: - Steroids by mouth or through a vein (intravenously) - Bronchodilators through a nebulizer - Oxygen therapy - Assistance from a machine to help breathing by using a mask, BiPAP, or through the use of an endotracheal tube Your health care provider may prescribe antibiotics during symptom flare-ups, because an infection can make COPD worse. You may need oxygen therapy at home if you have a low level of oxygen in your blood. Pulmonary rehabilitation does not cure COPD. But it can teach you to breathe in a different way so you can stay active and feel better. LIVING WITH COPD You can do things every day to keep COPD from getting worse, protect your lungs, and stay healthy. Walk to build up strength: - Ask the provider or therapist how far to walk. - Slowly increase how far you walk. - Avoid talking if you get short of breath when you walk. - Use pursed lip breathing when you breathe out, to empty your lungs before the next breath. Things you can do to make it easier for yourself around the home include: - Avoid very cold air or very hot weather - Make sure no one smokes in your home - Reduce air pollution by not using the fireplace and getting rid of other irritants - Manage stress in your mood Eat healthy foods, including fish, poultry, and lean meat, as well as fruits and vegetables. If it is hard to keep your weight up, talk to a provider or dietitian about eating foods with more calories. Surgery may be used to treat COPD. Only a few people benefit from these surgical treatments: - Surgery to remove parts of the diseased lung, which can help less-diseased parts work better in some people with emphysema - Lung transplant for a small number of very severe cases
2.0	what the treatment for bronchitis	Bronchitis: Español Bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed. These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.) People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath. Bronchitis Overview The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing). Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed). Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone. Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis Industrial bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition. Certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse. Being exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis. Chronic Bronchitis Repeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition. Breathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis. People who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis. Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year. Elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. People of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. Air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 days. The cough may produce clear mucus (a slimy substance). If the mucus is yellow or green, you may have a bacterial infection as well. Even after the infection clears up, you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is severe, you also may have shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Chronic Bronchitis The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. The coughing may produce large amounts of mucus. This type of cough often is called a smoker&aposs cough. Your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. He or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you&aposve had it, what you&aposre coughing up, and how much you cough. Your doctor also will likely ask: About your medical history Whether you&aposve recently had a cold or the flu Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke Whether you&aposve been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. He or she also may: Look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection Test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe Recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. Antibiotics usually aren&apost prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don&apost work against viruses—the most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it&aposs very important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution.

Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. You can&apost always prevent acute or chronic bronchitis. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for both conditions. The most important step is to quit smoking or not start smoking.

Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition.

Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar.

All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you&aposre blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling.
0.555555555556	what the treatment for bronchitis	Chronic Bronchitis (Summary): Summary Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. Chronic bronchitis is one type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The inflamed bronchial tubes produce a lot of mucus. This leads to coughing and difficulty breathing. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause. Breathing in air pollution, fumes, or dust over a long period of time may also cause it. To diagnose chronic bronchitis, your doctor will look at your signs and symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests. Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition that keeps coming back or never goes away completely. If you smoke, it is important to quit. Treatment can help with your symptoms. It often includes medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. You may also need oxygen therapy. Pulmonary rehabilitation may help you manage better in daily life.

0.222222222222	what the treatment for bronchitis	Industrial bronchitis: Industrial bronchitis is swelling (inflammation) of the large airways of the lungs that occurs in some people who work around certain dusts, fumes, smoke, or other substances. Exposure to dusts, fumes, strong acids, and other chemicals in the air causes this type of bronchitis. Smoking may also contribute. You may be at risk if you are exposed to dusts that contain: - Asbestos - Coal - Cotton - Flax - Latex - Metals - Silica - Talc - Toluene diisocyanate - Western red cedar Symptoms may include any of the following: - Cough that brings up mucus (sputum) - Shortness of breath - Wheezing The health care provider will listen to your lungs using a stethoscope. Wheezing sounds or crackles may be heard. Tests that may be ordered include: - Chest CT scan - Chest x-ray - Pulmonary function tests (to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning) The goal of treatment is to reduce the irritation. Getting more air into the workplace or wearing masks to filter out the offending dust particles may help. Some people may need to be taken out of the workplace. Some cases of industrial bronchitis go away without treatment. Other times, a person may need inhaled anti-inflammatory medicines. If you are at risk or have experienced this problem and you smoke, stop smoking. Helpful measures include: - Breathing humidified air - Increasing fluid intake - Resting The outcome may be good as long as you can stop being exposed to the irritant. Chronic disability from industrial bronchitis is rare. Continued exposure to irritating gases, fumes, or other substances can lead to permanent lung damage. Call your provider if you are regularly exposed to dusts, fumes, strong acids, or other chemicals that can affect the lungs and you develop symptoms of bronchitis. Control dust in industrial settings by wearing face masks and protective clothing, and by treating textiles. Stop smoking if you are at risk. Get early screening by a doctor if you are exposed to chemicals that can cause this condition. If you think a chemical you work with is affecting your breathing, ask your employer for a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet. Bring it with you to your provider.

1.88888888889	what the treatment for bronchitis	Bronchitis: Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may be either acute or chronic. Often developing from a cold or other respiratory infection, acute bronchitis is very common. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. Acute bronchitis, also called a chest cold, usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. However, if you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For either acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: - Cough - Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color - rarely, it may be streaked with blood - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - Slight fever and chills - Chest discomfort If you have acute bronchitis, you might have cold symptoms, such as a mild headache or body aches. While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you&aposre likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. At those times, you may have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis. See your doctor if your cough: - Lasts more than three weeks - Prevents you from sleeping - Is accompanied by fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C) - Produces discolored mucus - Produces blood - Is associated with wheezing or shortness of breath Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Antibiotics don&apost kill viruses, so this type of medication isn&apost useful in most cases of bronchitis. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition. Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include: - Cigarette smoke. People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis. - Low resistance. This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection. - Exposure to irritants on the job. Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes. - Gastric reflux. Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis. Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn&apost cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe. In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests: - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you ever were or currently are a smoker. - Sputum tests. Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies. - Pulmonary function test. During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma or emphysema. Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks. Medications Because most cases of bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren&apost effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic. In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including: - Cough medicine. If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime. - Other medications. If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs. Therapies If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation - a breathing exercise program in which a respiratory therapist teaches you how to breathe more easily and increase your ability to exercise. To help you feel better, you may want to try the following self-care measures: - Avoid lung irritants. Don&apost smoke. Wear a mask when the air is polluted or if you&aposre exposed to irritants, such as paint or household cleaners with strong fumes. - Use a humidifier. Warm, moist air helps relieve coughs and loosens mucus in your airways. But be sure to clean the humidifier according to the manufacturer&aposs recommendations to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi in the water container. - Consider a face mask outside. If cold air aggravates your cough and causes shortness of breath, put on a cold-air face mask before you go outside.

Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you&aposre blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling.
1.875	what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox	Chickenpox (Treatment): In otherwise healthy children, chickenpox typically requires no medical treatment. Your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine to relieve itching. But for the most part, the disease is allowed to run its course. If you&aposre at high risk of complications For people who have a high risk of complications from chickenpox, doctors sometimes prescribe medications to shorten the duration of the infection and to help reduce the risk of complications. If you or your child falls into a high-risk group, your doctor may suggest an antiviral drug such as acyclovir (Zovirax) or another drug called immune globulin intravenous (Privigen). These medications may lessen the severity of the disease when given within 24 hours after the rash first appears. Other antiviral drugs, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir), also may lessen the severity of the disease, but may not be approved or appropriate for all cases. In some instances, your doctor may recommend getting the chickenpox vaccine after exposure to the virus. This can prevent the disease or lessen its severity. Don&apost give anyone with chickenpox - child or adult - any medicine containing aspirin because this combination has been associated with a condition called Reye&aposs syndrome. Treating complications If complications do develop, your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment. Treatment for skin infections and pneumonia may be with antibiotics. Treatment for encephalitis is usually with antiviral drugs. Hospitalization may be necessary.
2.0	what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox	What are the treatments for Chickenpox?: Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important forthose who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others.
1.5	what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox	Chickenpox: Chickenpox (varicella) is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven&apost had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Before routine chickenpox vaccination, virtually all people had been infected by the time they reached adulthood, sometimes with serious complications. Today, the number of cases and hospitalizations is down dramatically. For most people, chickenpox is a mild disease. Still, it&aposs better to get vaccinated. The chickenpox vaccine is a safe, effective way to prevent chickenpox and its possible complications. Chickenpox infection appears 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus and usually lasts about five to 10 days. The rash is the telltale indication of chickenpox. Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash, include: - Fever - Loss of appetite - Headache - Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise) Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: - Raised pink or red bumps (papules), which break out over several days - Small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), forming from the raised bumps over about one day before breaking and leaking - Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take several more days to heal New bumps continue to appear for several days. As a result, you may have all three stages of the rash - bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions - at the same time on the second day of the rash. Once infected, you can spread the virus for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and you remain contagious until all spots crust over. The disease is generally mild in healthy children. In severe cases, the rash can spread to cover the entire body, and lesions may form in the throat, eyes and mucous membranes of the urethra, anus and vagina. New spots continue to appear for several days. When to see a doctor If you suspect that you or your child has chickenpox, consult your doctor. He or she usually can diagnose chickenpox by examining the rash and by noting the presence of accompanying symptoms. Your doctor can also prescribe medications to lessen the severity of chickenpox and treat complications, if necessary. Be sure to call ahead for an appointment and mention you think you or your child has chickenpox, to avoid waiting and possibly infecting others in a waiting room. Also, be sure to let your doctor know if any of these complications occur: - The rash spreads to one or both eyes. - The rash gets very red, warm or tender, indicating a possible secondary bacterial skin infection. - The rash is accompanied by dizziness, disorientation, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, tremors, loss of muscle coordination, worsening cough, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38.9 C). - Anyone in the household is immune deficient or younger than 6 months old. Chickenpox, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is highly contagious, and it can spread quickly. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the rash or by droplets dispersed into the air by coughing or sneezing. Your risk of catching chickenpox is higher if you: - Haven&apost had chickenpox - Haven&apost been vaccinated for chickenpox - Work in or attend a school or child care facility - Live with children Most people who have had chickenpox or have been vaccinated against chickenpox are immune to chickenpox. If you&aposve been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare. Chickenpox is normally a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to complications or death, especially in high-risk people. Complications include: - Bacterial infections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream (sepsis) - Dehydration - Pneumonia - Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) - Toxic shock syndrome - Reye&aposs syndrome for people who take aspirin during chickenpox Who&aposs at risk? Those at high risk of having complications from chickenpox include: - Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine - Adults - Pregnant women who haven&apost had chickenpox - People whose immune systems are impaired by medication, such as chemotherapy, or another disease, such as cancer or HIV - People who are taking steroid medications for another disease or condition, such as children with asthma - People taking drugs that suppress their immune systems Chickenpox and pregnancy Other complications of chickenpox affect pregnant women. Chickenpox early in pregnancy can result in a variety of problems in a newborn, including low birth weight and birth defects, such as limb abnormalities. A greater threat to a baby occurs when the mother develops chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth. Then it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection in a newborn. If you&aposre pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your doctor about the risks to you and your unborn child. Chickenpox and shingles If you&aposve had chickenpox, you&aposre at risk of another disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus called shingles. After a chickenpox infection, some of the varicella-zoster virus may remain in your nerve cells. Many years later, the virus can reactivate and resurface as shingles - a painful band of short-lived blisters. The virus is more likely to reappear in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Shingles can lead to its own complication - a condition in which the pain of shingles persists long after the blisters disappear. This complication, called postherpetic neuralgia, can be severe. A shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is available and is recommended for adults age 60 and older who have had chickenpox. Doctors generally diagnose chickenpox based on the telltale rash. If there&aposs any doubt about the diagnosis, chickenpox can be confirmed with laboratory tests, including blood tests or a culture of lesion samples. In otherwise healthy children, chickenpox typically requires no medical treatment. Your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine to relieve itching. But for the most part, the disease is allowed to run its course. If you&aposre at high risk of complications For people who have a high risk of complications from chickenpox, doctors sometimes prescribe medications to shorten the duration of the infection and to help reduce the risk of complications.

Treatment for encephalitis is usually with antiviral drugs. Hospitalization may be necessary. To help ease the symptoms of an uncomplicated case of chickenpox, follow these self-care measures. Don&apost scratch Scratching can cause scarring, slow healing and increase the risk that the sores will become infected. If your child can&apost stop scratching: - Put gloves on his or her hands, especially at night - Trim his or her fingernails Relieve the itch and other symptoms The chickenpox rash can be very itchy, and broken vesicles sometimes sting. These discomforts, along with fever, headache and fatigue, can make anyone miserable. For relief, try: - A cool bath with added baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal - a finely ground oatmeal that is made for soaking. - Calamine lotion dabbed on the spots. - A soft, bland diet if chickenpox sores develop in the mouth. - Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl, others) for itching. Check with your doctor to make sure your child can safely take antihistamines. - Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, Children&aposs Motrin, others) for a mild fever. Don&apost give aspirin to anyone with chickenpox because it can lead to a serious condition called Reye&aposs syndrome. And don&apost treat a high fever without consulting your doctor.

1.625	what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox	Chickenpox (Summary): Summary Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Most cases are in children under age 15, but older children and adults can get it. It spreads very easily from one person to another. The classic symptom of chickenpox is an uncomfortable, itchy rash. The rash turns into fluid-filled blisters and eventually into scabs. It usually shows up on the face, chest, and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms include - Fever - Headache - Tiredness - Loss of appetite Chickenpox is usually mild and lasts 5 to 10 days. Calamine lotions and oatmeal baths can help with itching. Acetaminophen can treat the fever. Do not use aspirin for chickenpox; that combination can cause Reye syndrome. Chickenpox can sometimes cause serious problems. Adults, babies, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with weak immune systems tend to get sicker from it. They may need to take antiviral medicines. Once you catch chickenpox, the virus usually stays in your body. You probably will not get chickenpox again, but the virus can cause shingles in adults. A chickenpox vaccine can help prevent most cases of chickenpox, or make it less severe if you do get it. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
-1.875	what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox	Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine (Who should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait?): - People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine. - People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. - Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. - Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system; is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer; has any kind of cancer; is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs - People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine.
1.0	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	Calcium carbonate overdose: Calcium carbonate is commonly found in antacids (for heartburn) and some dietary supplements. Calcium carbonate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of a product containing this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Calcium carbonate can be dangerous in large amounts. Some products that contain calcium carbonate are certain: - Antacids (Tums, Chooz) - Mineral supplements - Hand lotions - Vitamin and mineral supplements Other products may also contain calcium carbonate. Symptoms of a calcium carbonate overdose include: - Abdominal pain - Bone pain - Coma - Confusion - Constipation - Depression - Diarrhea - Headache - Irregular heartbeat - Muscle twitching - Nausea - Vomiting Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Have this information ready: - Person&aposs age, weight, and condition - The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) - When it was swallowed - The amount swallowed Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person&aposs vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood tests may be done. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: - Activated charcoal - Blood and urine tests - Breathing support - Chest x-ray - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Intravenous fluids (through a vein) - Laxative - Medicine to treat symptoms - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach (gastric lavage) Calcium carbonate is not very poisonous. Recovery is quite likely. But, long-term overuse is more serious than a single overdose, because it can cause kidney damage. Few people die from an antacid overdose. Keep all medicines in child-proof bottles and out of the reach of children. Updated by: Jacob L. Heller, MD, MHA, Emergency Medicine, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA.

-1.33333333333	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	What is Overdose?: An overdose is when you take more than the normal or recommended amount of something, usually a drug. An overdose may result in serious, harmful symptoms or death. If you take too much of something on purpose, it is called an intentional or deliberate overdose. If the overdose happens by mistake, it is called an accidental overdose. For example, a young child may accidentally take an adult&aposs heart medicine. Your doctor may refer to an overdose as an ingestion. Ingestion means you swallowed something. An overdose is not the same as a poisoning, although the effects can be the same. Poisoning occurs when someone or something (such as the environment) exposes you to dangerous chemicals, plants, or other harmful substances without your knowledge.
-1.44444444444	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	Calcium - ionized: Ionized calcium is calcium in your blood that is not attached to proteins. It is also called free calcium. All cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function. It also helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting. This article discusses the test used to measure the amount of ionized calcium in blood. A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. You should not eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the test. Many medicines can interfere with blood test results. - Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. - DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. Your provider may order this test if you have signs of kidney or parathyroid disease. The test may also be done to monitor progress and treatment of these diseases. Most of the time, blood tests measure your total calcium level. This looks at both ionized calcium and calcium attached to proteins. You may need to have a separate ionized calcium test if you have factors that increase or decrease total calcium levels. These may include abnormal blood levels of albumin or immunoglobulins. - Children: 4.8 to 5.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 1.20 to 1.32 millimoles per liter (millimol/L) - Adults: 4.8 to 5.6 mg/dL or 1.20 to 1.40 millimol/L Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Higher-than-normal levels of ionized calcium may be due to: - Decreased levels of calcium in the urine from an unknown cause - Hyperparathyroidism - Hyperthyroidism - Milk-alkali syndrome - Multiple myeloma - Paget disease - Sarcoidosis - Thiazide diuretics - Thrombocytosis (high platelet count) - Tumors - Vitamin A excess - Vitamin D excess Lower-than-normal levels may be due to: - Hypoparathyroidism - Malabsorption - Osteomalacia - Pancreatitis - Renal failure - Rickets - Vitamin D deficiency Updated by: Laura J.

-1.55555555556	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	What is Overdose?: An overdose may be mild, moderate, or serious. Symptoms, treatment, and recovery depend on the specific drug involved. In the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 to speak with a local poison control center. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. You should call if you have any questions about an overdose, poisoning, or poison prevention. You can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At the emergency room, an examination will be performed. The following tests and treatments may be needed: - Activated charcoal - Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator) - Blood and urine tests - Chest x-ray - CT (computed tomography, or advanced imaging) scan - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV) - Laxative - Medicines to treat symptoms, including antidotes (if one exists) to reverse the effects of the overdose
-1.66666666667	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	Calcium in diet: Calcium is the most plentiful mineral found in the human body. The teeth and bones contain the most calcium. Nerve cells, body tissues, blood, and other body fluids contain the rest of the calcium. Calcium is one of the most important minerals for the human body. It helps form and maintain healthy teeth and bones. A proper level of calcium in the body over a lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis. Calcium helps your body with: - Building strong bones and teeth - Clotting blood - Sending and receiving nerve signals - Squeezing and relaxing muscles - Releasing hormones and other chemicals - Keeping a normal heartbeat CALCIUM AND DAIRY PRODUCTS Many foods contain calcium, but dairy products are the best source. Milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheeses, and buttermilk contain a form of calcium that your body can easily absorb. Whole milk (4% fat) is recommended for children ages 1 to 2. Most adults and children over age 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) milk or skim milk and other dairy products. Removing the fat will not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product. - Yogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk are excellent sources of calcium and come in low-fat or fat-free versions. - Milk is also a good source of phosphorus and magnesium, which help the body absorb and use calcium. - Vitamin D is needed to help your body use calcium. Milk is fortified with vitamin D for this reason. OTHER SOURCES OF CALCIUM Other sources of calcium that can help meet your body&aposs calcium needs include: - Green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy or Chinese cabbage - Salmon and sardines canned with their soft bones - Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans - Blackstrap molasses Calcium is often added to food products. These include foods such as orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. These are a very good source of calcium for people who do not eat a lot of dairy products. Ways to make sure you get enough calcium in your diet: - Cook foods in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time to keep more calcium in the foods you eat. (This means steaming or sautéing to cook instead of boiling foods.) - Be careful about the other foods you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran, and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb) can bind with calcium and prevent it from being absorbed. This is why leafy greens are not considered an adequate source of calcium by themselves, because your body is unable to utilize much of the calcium they contain. People on a vegan diet need to be sure to also include soy products and fortified products in order to get enough calcium. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Calcium is also found in many multivitamin-mineral supplements. The amount varies, depending on the supplement. Dietary supplements may contain only calcium, or calcium with other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the label on the Supplement Facts panel of the package to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. Calcium absorption is best when taken in amounts of no more than 500 mg at a time. Two commonly available forms of calcium dietary supplements include calcium citrate and calcium carbonate. - Calcium citrate is the more expensive form of the supplement. It is taken up well by the body on a full or empty stomach. - Calcium carbonate is less expensive. It is absorbed better by the body if taken with food. Calcium carbonate is found in over-the-counter antacid products such as Rolaids or Tums. Each chew or pill usually provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium. Check the label for the exact amount. Other types of calcium in supplements and foods include calcium lactate, calcium gluconate, and calcium phosphate. Increased calcium for a limited period of time does not normally cause side effects. However, receiving higher amounts of calcium over a long period of time raises the risk of kidney stones in some people. Those who do not receive enough calcium over a long period of time can develop osteoporosis (thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density over time). Other disorders are also possible. People with lactose intolerance have trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk. Over-the-counter products are available that make it easier to digest lactose. You can also buy lactose-free milk at most grocery stores. Most people who do not suffer from severe lactose-intolerance are still able to digest hard cheeses and yogurt. Tell your health care provider about any dietary supplements and medicines you take. Your provider can tell you if those dietary supplements might interact or interfere with your prescription or over-the-counter medicines. In addition, some medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs calcium. The preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplement. How much calcium you need depends on your age and gender. Other factors, such as pregnancy and illnesses, are also important. Recommendations for calcium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include: - Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence. - Adequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition. The preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplement if they do not get enough calcium from the foods they eat. Infants (AI): - 0 to 6 months: 200 milligrams per day (mg/day) - 7 to 12 months: 260 mg/day Children and adolescents (RDA): - Age 1 to 3: 700 mg/day - Age 4 to 8: 1,000 mg/day - Age 9 to 18: 1,300 mg/day Adults (RDA): - Age 19 to 50: 1,000 mg/day - Age 50 to 70: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day - Over age 71: 1,200 mg/day Pregnancy and breastfeeding (RDA): - Age 14 to 18: 1,300 mg/day - Age 19 to 50: 1,000 mg/day Up to 2,500 to 3,000 mg a day of calcium from dietary sources and supplements appears to be safe for children and adolescents, and 2,000 to 2,500 mg a day appears to be safe for adults. The following list can help you determine roughly how much calcium you are getting from food: - 8-ounce (240 milliliter) glass of milk = 300 mg of calcium - 1.5 ounces (42 grams) of Swiss cheese = 300 mg of calcium - 6 ounces (168 grams) of yogurt = 300 mg of calcium - 3 ounces (84 grams) of sardines with bones = 200 mg of calcium - ½ cup (82 grams) of cooked turnip greens = 100 mg of calcium - ¼ cup (23 grams) of almonds = 100 mg of calcium - 1 medium orange = 50 mg calcium - 1 medium baked sweet potato = 50 mg calcium Vitamin D is needed to help the body absorb calcium. When choosing a calcium supplement, look for one that also contains vitamin D. Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

-1.77777777778	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	Calcium supplements: WHO SHOULD TAKE CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS? Calcium is an important mineral for the human body. It helps build and protect your teeth and bones. Getting enough calcium over your lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis. Most people get enough calcium in their normal diet. Dairy foods and leafy green vegetables have high levels of calcium. Older women and men may need extra calcium to prevent their bones from getting thin (osteoporosis). Your health care provider will tell you if you need to take extra calcium. TYPES OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS Forms of calcium include: - Calcium carbonate. Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 mg or more of calcium. - Calcium citrate. This is a more expensive form of calcium. It is absorbed well on an empty or full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid (a condition that is more common in people over age 50) absorb calcium citrate better than calcium carbonate. - Other forms, such as calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, calcium phosphate: Most have less calcium than the carbonate and citrate forms. When choosing a calcium supplement: - Look the word "purified" or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label. - Avoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite that do not have the USP symbol. They may have high levels of lead or other toxic metals. HOW TO TAKE EXTRA CALCIUM Follow your provider&aposs advice on how much extra calcium you need. Increase the dose of your calcium supplement slowly. Your provider may suggest that you start with 500 mg a day for a week, and then add more over time. Try to spread the extra calcium you take over the day. DO NOT take more than 500 mg at a time. Taking calcium throughout the day will: - Allow more calcium to be absorbed - Cut down on side effects such as gas, bloating, and constipation The total amount of calcium adults need every day from food and calcium supplements: - 19 to 50 years: 1,000 mg/day - 51 to 70 years: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day - 71 years and over: 1,200 mg/day The body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight exposure to your skin and from your diet. Ask your provider whether you need to take a vitamin D supplement. SIDE EFFECTS AND SAFETY DO NOT take more than the recommended amount of calcium without your provider&aposs OK. Try the following if you have side effects from taking extra calcium: - Drink more fluids. - Eat high-fiber foods - Switch to another form of calcium if the diet changes do not help. Always tell your provider and pharmacist if you are taking extra calcium. Calcium supplements may change the way your body absorbs some medicines. These include certain types of antibiotics and iron pills. Be aware of the following: - Taking extra calcium over a long period of time raises the risk of kidney stones in some people. - Too much calcium can prevent the body from absorbing iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus. - Antacids have other ingredients such as sodium, aluminum, and sugar. Ask your provider if antacids are OK for you to use as a calcium supplement. Updated by: Laura J.

-0.111111111111	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	Calcium Carbonate: Calcium carbonate is a dietary supplement used when the amount of calcium taken in the diet is not enough. Calcium is needed by the body for healthy bones, muscles, nervous system, and heart. Calcium carbonate also is used as an antacid to relieve heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach. It is available with or without a prescription. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Calcium carbonate comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, capsule, and liquid to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription or package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take calcium carbonate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. When using this medicine as a dietary supplement, take it with food or following meals. Chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly before being swallowed; do not swallow them whole. Drink a full glass of water after taking either the regular or chewable tablets or capsules. Some liquid forms of calcium carbonate must be shaken well before use. Do not take calcium carbonate as an antacid for more than 2 weeks unless your doctor tells you to. Before taking calcium carbonate, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to calcium carbonate or any other drugs. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially digoxin (Lanoxin), etidronate (Didronel), phenytoin (Dilantin), tetracycline (Sumycin), and vitamins. Do not take calcium carbonate within 1-2 hours of taking other medicines. Calcium may decrease the effectiveness of the other medicine. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney disease or stomach conditions. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking calcium carbonate, call your doctor. If you are taking calcium carbonate on a regular schedule, take the missed dose as soon you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Calcium carbonate may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - upset stomach - vomiting - stomach pain - belching - constipation - dry mouth - increased urination - loss of appetite - metallic taste Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA&aposs Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.

-1.88888888889	who is at higher risk for calcium overdose?	Coronary Calcium Scan: Also known as calcium scan test. A coronary calcium scan is a CT scan of your heart that detects and measures the amount of calcium in the walls of your coronary arteries. Buildup of calcium, or calcifications, are a sign of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, or coronary microvascular disease. A coronary calcium scan may be performed in a medical imaging facility or hospital. The test does not use contrast dye and will take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. A coronary calcium scan uses a special scanner such as an electron beam CT or a multidetector CT (MDCT) machine. An MDCT machine is a much faster CT scanner that makes high-quality pictures of the beating heart. A coronary calcium scan will determine an Agatston score that reflects the amount of calcium found in your coronary arteries. A score of zero is normal. In general, the higher your score, the more likely you are to have heart disease. If your score is high, your doctor may recommend more tests. A coronary calcium scan has few risks. There is a slight risk of cancer, particularly in people younger than 40 years old. However, the amount of radiation from one test is similar to the amount of radiation you are naturally exposed to over one year. Talk to your doctor and the technicians performing the test about whether you are or could be pregnant. If the test is not urgent, they may have you wait to do the test until after your pregnancy. If it is urgent, the technicians will take extra steps to protect your baby during this test. Visit CT Scans for more information about this topic.

2.0	who is at risk for contracting dengue fever? is there a certain age group or race that contracts dengue fever?	Dengue (Summary): Summary Dengue is an infection caused by a virus. You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids. To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found - Wear insect repellent with DEET - Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet - Close unscreened doors and windows NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

-0.571428571429	who is at risk for contracting dengue fever? is there a certain age group or race that contracts dengue fever?	Dengue fever (Causes): Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses spread by mosquitoes that thrive in and near human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito. When the infected mosquito then bites another person, the virus enters that person&aposs bloodstream. After you&aposve recovered from dengue fever, you have immunity to the type of virus that infected you - but not to the other three dengue fever virus types. The risk of developing severe dengue fever, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, actually increases if you&aposre infected a second, third or fourth time.
1.85714285714	who is at risk for contracting dengue fever? is there a certain age group or race that contracts dengue fever?	Dengue Fever: Dengue fever is an infectious disease carried by mosquitoes and caused by any of four related dengue viruses. This disease used to be called "break-bone" fever because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking. Health experts have known about dengue fever for more than 200 years.  Worldwide, about 50 million cases of dengue infection occur each year, with 22,000 deaths, mostly in children. This includes 100 to 200 cases in the United States, mostly in people who have recently traveled abroad. Many more cases likely go unreported because some healthcare providers do not recognize the disease. In the Western hemisphere, the estimated economic burden of dengue is about $2.1 billion per year. Recognizing the threat to public health posed by dengue, NIAID is funding nearly 60 dengue research projects, including studies on dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, the most severe forms of the disease. NIAID research priorities include effective community-based prevention programs, improved laboratory-based international surveillance, rapid diagnostic tests and therapies, and development of and clinical trials for dengue vaccines.

To answer these questions, NIAID supports a wide-range of basic research activities aimed at better understanding the biology of the dengue virus, the progression of disease in infected people, and the interactions between the virus and the immune system. New research findings are shedding light on the mechanisms of dengue infection, such as how the virus enters the cells and how the human immune system responds to dengue infection. Other NIAID projects are identifying the human and viral factors that determine and contribute to the severity and transmissibility of this disease. NIAID researchers are actively engaged in the search for an effective vaccine against dengue fever. The vaccine approach that is currently been evaluated at NIAID for efficacy against dengue animal models and human trials is a weakened recombinant version (live-attenuated) of the dengue virus. Other NIAID-funded investigators are working to develop dengue vaccines using different live-attenuated dengue viruses, recombinant proteins, viral vectors, and DNA. NIAID-supported scientists are working to understand the pathology of dengue disease and to develop cost-effective, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests for use in dengue-endemic countries. The goal of these tests is to provide early detection of the disease, distinguish between the different viral dengue, and predict which people are at highest risk of developing the more severe forms of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Quick and effective diagnosis of dengue is critical to effectively control outbreaks, treat the disease, and reduce mortality. In one project supported by NIAID, researchers are developing an automated, portable, point-of-care machine for rapid dengue diagnosis  NIAID-supported investigators are pursuing several approaches to treat dengue infection. Some scientists are working to identify cellular and viral proteins to use as targets for drug intervention. In other studies, researchers are generating and evaluating neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drugs in animal models. Results from these animal trials may result in new treatment options for people with dengue. In one NIAID-funded contract, researchers evaluated about 7,500 antiviral compounds in vitro to test their efficacy against dengue. So far, 49 have been identified for further evaluation.
-0.714285714286	who is at risk for contracting dengue fever? is there a certain age group or race that contracts dengue fever?	Dengue fever (Symptoms): Many people, especially children and teens, may experience no signs or symptoms during a mild case of dengue fever. When symptoms do occur, they usually begin four to seven days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. Dengue fever causes a high fever - 104 F degrees - and at least two of the following symptoms: - Headache - Muscle, bone and joint pain - Nausea - Vomiting - Pain behind the eyes - Swollen glands - Rash Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. Blood vessels often become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can cause a severe form of dengue fever, called dengue hemorrhagic fever, severe dengue or dengue shock syndrome. Signs and symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever or severe dengue - a life-threatening emergency - include: - Severe abdominal pain - Persistent vomiting - Bleeding from your gums or nose - Blood in your urine, stools or vomit - Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising - Difficult or rapid breathing - Cold or clammy skin (shock) - Fatigue - Irritability or restlessness When to see a doctor Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room if you&aposve recently visited a region in which dengue fever is known to occur and you develop emergency symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, or blood in your nose, gums, vomit or stools. If you develop a fever and milder symptoms common to dengue fever, call your doctor.

0.714285714286	who is at risk for contracting dengue fever? is there a certain age group or race that contracts dengue fever?	Dengue fever (Summary): The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 99828 Disease definition Dengue fever (DF), caused by dengue virus , is an arboviral disease characterized by an initial non-specific febrile illness that can sometimes progress to more severe forms manifesting capillary leakage and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever, or DHF) and shock (dengue shock syndrome , or DSS). Epidemiology DF is found in the tropics worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and the Americas, with 40% of the global population at risk. An estimated 50 to 100 million cases of DF, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 20,000 deaths occur yearly worldwide. Clinical description The vast majority of dengue virus infections result in DF, which is characterized by sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache (classically retro-orbital), and myalgia/arthralgia, often followed soon after by a petechial rash, which may be pruritic. In most cases, symptoms will resolve within 7 days without further complications. However, in a small minority of patients, a brief period of deffervescence is followed by worsening abdominal symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage (DHF: epistaxis, bleeding gums, gastrointestinal bleeding) and a capillary leak syndrome (DSS: hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, pleural effusion, shock). DHF/DSS are seen most often in children under the age of 15 years. Risk is greater with secondary heterologous infection by one of the four dengue virus serotypes, but severe disease may be seen with first infections. Etiology Over 25 different viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever. Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. Four distinct serotypes, with significant strain variation, are recognized. Dengue viruses are maintained in humans and transmitted between them by the bite of infected mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti but also Aedes albopictus). Person-to-person transmission has not been reported. Diagnostic methods Common diagnostic modalities include serologic testing by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virus isolation may also be performed in specialized laboratories. The viremic phase of DF/DHF is usually brief (first 3-5 days of illness), after which time detection of anti-dengue IgM antibodies , which appear as early as 2-4 days after disease onset, is the mainstay. Numerous commercial ELISA assays are available with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Differential diagnosis DF is difficult to distinguish from a host of other febrile illnesses such as malaria and typhoid fever (see these terms), especially early in the course of disease before the rash appears. For DHF/DSS, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection (see these terms) and meningococcemia need to be excluded. Management and treatment As there is presently no antiviral drug available for DF/DHF, treatment is supportive, following the guidelines for treatment of severe septicemia. Insecticide-treated bed nets, room screens and elimination of larval development sites should be used in open-air settings to prevent further transmission. Prognosis Case-fatality rates for DF are less than 1% but may rise to as high as 40% in DHF/DSS, largely dependent upon whether access to advanced medical care exists. Children and persons with underlying chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma are at increased risk. The most severe phase of disease usually lasts only a few days and survivors generally have no lasting sequelae. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.
0.777777777778	why can you not take grapefruit with felodipine	Felodipine: Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure. Felodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so your heart does not have to pump as hard. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation. Felodipine comes as an extended release tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take felodipine, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take felodipine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Felodipine controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take felodipine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking felodipine without talking to your doctor. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

-0.888888888889	why can you not take grapefruit with felodipine	What is Grapefruit?: Grapefruit is a citrus fruit. People use the fruit, oil from the peel, and extracts from the seed as medicine. Grapefruit seed extract is processed from grapefruit seeds and pulp obtained as a byproduct from grapefruit juice production. Vegetable glycerin is added to the final product to reduce acidity and bitterness. Grapefruit juice is used for high cholesterol, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), cancer, a skin disease called psoriasis, and for weight loss and obesity. Grapefruit seed extract is taken by mouth for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections including yeast infections. Grapefruit oil is applied to the skin for muscle fatigue, hair growth, toning the skin, and for acne and oily skin. It is also used for the common cold and flu (influenza). Grapefruit seed extract is applied to the skin as a facial cleanser, first-aid treatment, remedy for mild skin irritations, and as a vaginal douche for vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis). It is also used as an ear or nasal rinse for preventing and treating infections; as a gargle for sore throats; and a dental rinse for preventing gingivitis and promoting healthy gums; and as a breath freshener. Some people inhale grapefruit vapors to help the body retain water, for headache, stress, and depression. Grapefruit seed extract vapor has also been inhaled for the treatment of lung infections. In food and beverages, grapefruit is consumed as a fruit, juice, and is used as a flavoring component. In manufacturing, grapefruit oil and seed extract are used as a fragrance component in soaps and cosmetics; and as a household cleaner for fruits, vegetables, meats, kitchen surfaces, dishes, etc. In agriculture, grapefruit seed extract is used to kill bacteria and fungus, fight mold growth, kill parasites in animal feeds, preserve food and disinfect water. Its important to remember that drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented. The chemistry of the grapefruit varies by the species, the growing conditions, and the process used to extract the juice. Before adding grapefruit to your diet or your list of natural medicines, check with your healthcare provider if you take medications.

0.875	can i take keflex to cure staph?	Staph infections (Treatment): Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you&aposre given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today&aposs staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin.

Never squeeze a boil or try to cut it open at home, because this can spread the infection and make it worse. You need to seek treatment if the carbuncle: - Lasts longer than 2 weeks - Returns frequently - Is located on the spine or the middle of the face - Occurs with a fever or other systemic symptoms Treatment helps reduce complications related to an infection.Your provider may prescribe: - Antibacterial soaps - Antibiotics applied to the skin or taken by mouth Deep or large lesions may need to be drained by your provider. Proper hygiene is very important to prevent the spread of infection. - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after touching a carbuncle. - Do not re-use or share washcloths or towels. This can cause the infection to spread. - Clothing, washcloths, towels, and sheets or other items that contact infected areas should be washed in very hot (preferably boiling) water. - Bandages should be changed often and thrown away in a bag that can be tightly closed.

If you have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or another staph infection, follow instructions for self-care at home. 
2.0	can i take keflex to cure staph?	Staph infections: Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy individuals. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections. But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: - Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn&apost cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Dehydration - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person&aposs bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs - Bones and muscles - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever - Nausea and vomiting - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn - Confusion - Muscle aches - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling - Severe pain in the affected joint - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin - Pus-filled blisters - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there&aposs a good chance that it&aposs from bacteria you&aposve been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying - Extremes of temperature - Stomach acid - High levels of salt A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin - HIV/AIDS - Kidney failure requiring dialysis - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems - Burns - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing - Urinary catheters - Feeding tubes - Breathing tubes - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don&apost properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they&aposre preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you&aposre given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today&aposs staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin.
-0.5	can i take keflex to cure staph?	Staph infections - hospital (Staph Infections in the Hospital): Staph germs are mostly spread by skin-to-skin contact (touching). A doctor, nurse, other health care provider, or even visitors may have staph germs on their body and then spread them to a patient. This can happen when: - A provider carries staph on the skin as normal bacteria. - A doctor, nurse, other provider, or visitor touches a person who has a staph infection. - A person develops a staph infection at home and brings this germ to the hospital. If the person then touches another person without washing their hands first, the staph germs may spread. Also, a patient may have a staph infection before coming to the hospital. This can occur without the person even being aware of it. In a few cases, people can get staph infections by touching clothing, sinks, or other objects that have staph germs on them. One type of staph germ, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is harder to treat. This is because MRSA is not killed by certain antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph germs.
-0.625	can i take keflex to cure staph?	Staph infections - hospital: "Staph" (pronounced staff) is short for Staphylococcus. Staph is a germ (bacteria) that can cause infections in any part of the body, but most are skin infections. Staph can infect openings in the skin, like scratches, pimples, or skin cysts. Anyone can get a staph infection. Hospital patients can get staph infections of the skin: - Anywhere a catheter or tube enters the body. This includes chest tubes, urinary catheters, IVs, or central lines - In surgical wounds, pressure sores (also called bed sores), or foot ulcers Once the staph germ enters the body, it can spread to bones, joints, and the blood. It can also spread to any organ, such as the lungs, heart, or brain. Staph can also spread from one person to another. Staph germs are mostly spread by skin-to-skin contact (touching). A doctor, nurse, other health care provider, or even visitors may have staph germs on their body and then spread them to a patient.

One type of staph germ, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is harder to treat. This is because MRSA is not killed by certain antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph germs. Many healthy people normally have staph on their skin. Most of the time, it does not cause an infection or symptoms. This is called being colonized with staph. These people are known as carriers. They can spread staph to others. Some people colonized with staph develop an actual staph infection that makes them sick. Common risk factors for developing a serious staph infection are: - Being in a hospital or other type of care facility for a long time - Having a weakened immune system or ongoing (chronic) illness - Having an open cut or sore - Having a medical device inside your body such as an artificial joint - Injecting illegal drugs - Living with or having close contact with a person who has staph - Being on kidney dialysis Any time an area of your skin appears red, swollen, or crusty, a staph infection may be the cause. The only way to know for sure is to have a test called a skin culture. To do the culture, your provider may use a cotton swab to collect a sample from an open wound, skin rash, or skin sore. A sample may also be taken from a wound, blood, or sputum (phlegm). The sample is sent to the lab for testing. The best way to prevent the spread of staph for everyone is to keep their hands clean. It is important to wash your hands thoroughly. To do this: - Wet your hands and wrists, then apply soap. - Rub your palms, backs of your hands, fingers, and in between your fingers until the soap is bubbly. - Rinse clean with running water. - Dry with a clean paper towel. - Use a paper towel to turn off the faucet. Alcohol-based gels may also be used if your hands are not visibly dirty. - These gels should be at least 60% alcohol. - Use enough gel to wet your hands completely. - Rub your hands until they are dry. Ask visitors to wash their hands before they come into your hospital room. They should also wash their hands when they leave your room. Health care workers and other hospital staff can prevent staph infection by: - Washing their hands before and after they touch every patient - Wearing gloves and other protective clothing when they treat wounds, touch IVs and catheters, and when they handle bodily fluids - Using the proper sterile techniques - Promptly cleaning up after dressing (bandage) changes, procedures, surgeries, and spills - Always using sterile equipment and sterile techniques when taking care of patients and equipment - Checking for and promptly reporting any sign of wound infections Many hospitals encourage patients to ask their providers if they have washed their hands. As a patient, you have the right to ask. Updated by: Laura J. Martin, MD, MPH, ABIM Board Certified in Internal Medicine and Hospice and Palliative Medicine, Atlanta, GA.

0.625	can i take keflex to cure staph?	Staphylococcal Infections (Summary): Summary Staph is short for Staphylococcus, a type of bacteria. There are over 30 types, but Staphylococcus aureus causes most staph infections (pronounced "staff infections"), including - Skin infections - Pneumonia - Food poisoning - Toxic shock syndrome - Blood poisoning (bacteremia) Skin infections are the most common. They can look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen and painful, and sometimes have pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo, which turns into a crust on the skin, or cellulitis, a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot. Anyone can get a staph skin infection. You are more likely to get one if you have a cut or scratch, or have contact with a person or surface that has staph bacteria. The best way to prevent staph is to keep hands and wounds clean. Most staph skin infections are easily treated with antibiotics or by draining the infection. Some staph bacteria such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are resistant to certain antibiotics, making infections harder to treat.
-0.3	could tetanus be a cause of death?	Tetanus (Summary): Summary Tetanus is a serious illness caused by Clostridium bacteria. The bacteria live in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria can enter the body through a deep cut, like those you might get from stepping on a nail, or through a burn. The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw. This makes it impossible to open your mouth or swallow. Tetanus is a medical emergency. You need to get treatment in a hospital. A vaccine can prevent tetanus. It is given as a part of routine childhood immunization. Adults should get a tetanus shot, or booster, every 10 years. If you get a bad cut or burn, see your doctor - you may need a booster. Immediate and proper wound care can prevent tetanus infection.
0.8	could tetanus be a cause of death?	What is Tetanus?: Tetanus is aninfection of the nervous system with a type of bacteria that is potentially deadly, called Clostridium tetani (C. tetani).
2.0	could tetanus be a cause of death?	Tetanus (Complications): Once tetanus toxin has bonded to your nerve endings it is impossible to remove. Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months. Complications of tetanus infection may include: - Broken bones. The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break. - Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism). A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches. - Death. Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death. Pneumonia is another cause of death.
1.9	could tetanus be a cause of death?	Tetanus: Tetanus is a serious bacterial disease that affects your nervous system, leading to painful muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus can interfere with your ability to breathe and can threaten your life. Tetanus is commonly known as "lockjaw." Thanks to the tetanus vaccine, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. However, the disease remains a threat to those who aren&apost up to date on their vaccinations, and is more common in developing countries. There&aposs no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after tetanus bacteria enter your body through a wound. The average incubation period is seven to 10 days. Common signs and symptoms of tetanus include: - Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles (trismus) - Stiffness of your neck muscles - Difficulty swallowing - Stiffness of your abdominal muscles - Painful body spasms lasting for several minutes, typically triggered by minor occurrences, such as a draft, loud noise, physical touch or light Possible other signs and symptoms include: - Fever - Sweating - Elevated blood pressure - Rapid heart rate See your doctor for a tetanus booster shot if you have a deep or dirty wound and you haven&apost had a booster shot in five years. If you aren&apost sure of when your last booster was, get a booster. Or see your doctor about a tetanus booster for any wound - especially if it might have been contaminated with dirt, animal feces or manure - if you haven&apost had a booster shot within the past 10 years or aren&apost sure of when you were last vaccinated. Spores of the bacteria that cause tetanus, Clostridium tetani, are found in soil, dust and animal feces. When they enter a deep flesh wound, spores grow into bacteria that can produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin, which impairs the nerves that control your muscles (motor neurons). The toxin can cause muscle stiffness and spasms - the major signs of tetanus. Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or adults who haven&apost kept up with their 10-year booster shots. You can&apost catch tetanus from a person who has it. The following increase your likelihood of getting tetanus: - Failure to get vaccinated or to keep up to date with booster shots against tetanus - An injury that lets tetanus spores into the wound - A foreign body, such as a nail or splinter Tetanus cases have developed from the following: - Puncture wounds - including from splinters, body piercings, tattoos, injection drugs - Gunshot wounds - Compound fractures - Burns - Surgical wounds - Injection drug use - Animal or insect bites - Infected foot ulcers - Dental infections - Infected umbilical stumps in newborns born of inadequately immunized mothers Once tetanus toxin has bonded to your nerve endings it is impossible to remove. Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months. Complications of tetanus infection may include: - Broken bones. The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break. - Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism).

Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death. Pneumonia is another cause of death. Doctors diagnose tetanus based on a physical exam, medical and immunization history, and the signs and symptoms of muscle spasms, stiffness and pain. Laboratory tests generally aren&apost helpful for diagnosing tetanus. Since there&aposs no cure for tetanus, treatment consists of wound care, medications to ease symptoms and supportive care. Wound care Cleaning the wound is essential to preventing growth of tetanus spores. This involves removing dirt, foreign objects and dead tissue from the wound. Medications - Antitoxin. Your doctor may give you a tetanus antitoxin, such as tetanus immune globulin. However, the antitoxin can neutralize only toxin that hasn&apost yet bonded to nerve tissue. - Antibiotics. Your doctor may also give you antibiotics, either orally or by injection, to fight tetanus bacteria. - Vaccine. All people with tetanus should receive the tetanus vaccine as soon as they&aposre diagnosed with the condition. - Sedatives. Doctors generally use powerful sedatives to control muscle spasms. - Other drugs. Other medications, such as magnesium sulfate and certain beta blockers, might be used to regulate involuntary muscle activity, such as your heartbeat and breathing. Morphine might be used for this purpose as well as sedation. Supportive therapies Severe tetanus infection often requires a long stay in an intensive care setting. Since sedatives can inhibit breathing, you might temporarily need a ventilator. Puncture wounds or other deep cuts, animal bites, or particularly dirty wounds put you at increased risk of tetanus infection. Get medical attention if the wound is deep and dirty, and particularly if you&aposre unsure of when you were last vaccinated. Leave unclean wounds open to avoid trapping bacteria in the wound with a bandage. Your doctor may need to clean the wound, prescribe an antibiotic and give you a booster shot of the tetanus toxoid vaccine. If you&aposve previously been immunized, your body should quickly make the needed antibodies to protect you against tetanus. If you have a minor wound, these steps will help prevent tetanus: - Control bleeding. Apply direct pressure to control bleeding. - Keep the wound clean. After the bleeding stops, rinse the wound thoroughly with clean running water. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a washcloth. If something is embedded in a wound, see your doctor. - Use an antibiotic. After you clean the wound, apply a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment, such as the multi-ingredient antibiotics Neosporin and Polysporin. These antibiotics won&apost make the wound heal faster, but they can discourage bacterial growth and infection. Certain ingredients in some ointments can cause a mild rash in some people. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment. - Cover the wound. Exposure to the air might speed healing, but bandages can keep the wound clean and keep harmful bacteria out. Blisters that are draining are vulnerable. Keep them covered until a scab forms. - Change the dressing. Apply a new dressing at least once a day or whenever the dressing becomes wet or dirty to help prevent infection. If you&aposre allergic to the adhesive used in most bandages, switch to adhesive-free dressings or sterile gauze and paper tape.
