Six	O

indicate	O
that	O

use	O

the	O
development	O

that	O

These	O

suggest	O
that	O
both	O
phenacetin	O

may	O
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
burden	O

the	O
risk	O

the	O

the	O
former	O

This	O
apparent	O
difference	O
in	O

may	O
not	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
differences	O
in	O
nephrotoxic	B

the	O
drugs	O
themselves	O

A	O
lower	O

risk	O
would	O
be	O
expected	O
for	O
acetaminophen	O
if	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
both	O
drugs	O
in	O

other	O
analgesics	O
was	O
higher	O
than	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
either	O
agent	O

Thus	O
,	O
acetaminophen	O
has	O
been	O
used	O
both	O
as	O
a	O
